San Bernardino Deputy Jim Evans, a Vietnam veteran and father of a three month old baby, told his wife something big is going to go down and we're not going to be ready for it. We're going to lose a lot of men here. The county is growing. We need to have two men in a car, not one man units. We need to be better equipped. Wait, where was he? San Bernardino. And he's a cop. Okay. Already not grasping the details. He's a cop and he said that. He's a Vietnam veteran. He's got a baby and he said... And he's a guy, right? He's a human who talks? Hi there. I do a podcast with Jimmy not listening. Hey, so he's a guy? Yeah. He talks. Hey, Jimmy, you listening? Okay. May 6th, 1980. Mira Loma, California. 10 314 50th Street. Anna Grimley was in her backyard hanging her laundry to dry as she often did. When she noticed her neighbors were hanging barbed wire across the top of their 15 foot high greenhouse. Well, everybody has ways to dry their clothes. It's a barbed wire line. She tried to joke with them. You must be, you must have a gold mine over there. And they just smiled and said nothing. Fuck you. Fuck you, lady. How about this? How about you go fuck yourself? Excuse me. The other neighbors started to think the two men who live there were planning something. A row of carpet nails is also tacked along the wooden fence surrounding the house, which meant that anyone who tried to grip the fence and climb over would have their hands cut. I don't think they're putting carpet up there at all. I think they're just putting the nails up there. No, they're gonna put carpet. No, Henry, it's been three days. It's fence to fence carpeting. I've seen it. Why are they gonna carpet their fence? It's fence to fence carpeting. It's the better you know best. The two men who lived in the house were Christopher Gregory Harvin, 29 years old and Gregory Wayne Smith, 27 years old. What Anna couldn't see inside was an underground room about six feet high, 10 foot long and eight foot wide. The room had been dug by the two men using a pulley with a pail attached to scoop out the dirt. Okay. The two men had moved in one year before and didn't associate with any of the neighbors. Well, yeah, they lived above the ground. You're mole people. That's right. They were very quiet, these two. Anna's husband quote, they were weird, real weirdos. Anything to add to that? No, that's my favorite guy. Okay. I think of any quote that's ever been on. They were weird. Real weirdos. Now I got nothing left to say. That's it. I'm out. All right. This wasn't the type of place where the area wasn't the time and place where gunshots were out of the out of the ordinary. Okay. Anna quote, you hear a lot of gunshots around here on account of the butchering of animals, you know. So you wouldn't know if there are any gunshots next door. Yeah. I'm married to Jimmy not listening. I'm Anna. Just don't get it. Oh, honey. People butchering animals again. No, I don't know. Those sounded like they were coming from next door. No, someone shot a pig. Yeah. Also, I really don't know if they're gonna carpet that fence. They're gonna do it. Both men had served in the military Smith had served in the artillery division of the army and had been honor honorably discharge. Harvin had been dishonorably discharged after three months of training. Interesting. They had moved into the house together about a year before they started putting up barbed wire. Okay. Well, you want to get to know your roomie before you're throwing the barbed wire. Thank you. It's a hard conversation. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. So there's something I have to show. What's up? I really like barbed wire. Oh my god. I know. No, no, no, no, no, no. I almost didn't say anything. Let's put carpet on the fence. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. Yes. I love you. I love you. Not in that way. No, no, no, no. I'm just like a barbed wire carpet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah. You're my barbed wire bro. Yeah. BWB. Yeah, bro. My barbed wire bro. Love you so much, man. They had both men had recently lost their jobs as maintenance men. Separate jobs. They were different janitors who had been let go from different janitor. You're not going to believe this. This is, you know, me too. You too. Yeah. You also couldn't clean shit well. Yeah. Fucking what? I hate mops. What do you like barbed wire? Don't I'm not kidding around. Dude, you know, I love it. Barbed wire bro. You're my BWB. He's my BWB. Harvin and also recently separated from his wife and they were self. I can't imagine why your wife ditched you. You're an out of work janitor who loves barbed wire. Come on. Talk about a catch. Boat that fish. They were boat that fish. Yeah. Get them on board when you got a winner. Net it. Yep. They were self professed gun nuts and anarchists. The description that would fit them best is rednecks. Hmm. Familiar. They hated the police and would talk about overthrowing the government and going back to the principles set forth in the constitution. Oh boy. Sounds very familiar. It's great when those people used to be fringe lunatics. Yeah, right. Yeah. Instead of power, the green house, which now had barbed wire on it was also wrapped in plastic. Inside they had 300 marijuana plants. Oh, nice. All right. Now I like these rednecks. Okay. Smith and Harvin had built a tunnel between the shed and the garage next to the house through which they would escape if the cops came. Wow. Okay. And in the garage they were collecting a lot of equipment. Okay. They had a cache of weapons, a number of semi-automatic rifles, which were modified to make them fully automatic. They had thousands of rounds of ammunition, including hollow point bullets. And there was an anarchist. So they're just like lethal weapon bad guys. Yeah. Right. Basically. And there was an anarchist cookbook, which is a manual that shows you how to make certain types of explosives using household items. I thought it was like the right pie for overthrowing the government. That's what I always thought it was too. Razzleberry. And they read it and they built many improvised pipe bombs. Okay. These were made by filling PC. It comes to it's yes anding when you're building those too. Always. Yes. And the nails. Yes. And BBs. Yes. And fingernails. These were made by filling PVC pipe with gunpowder and surrounding it with a beer can full of broken glass, bullets and concrete nails. Where would guys of this culture get a beer can? It is hard to, yeah, it is hard to think of surely the neighbors recycling the beer can was then wrapped with masking tape and a fuse was attached. Many of the pipe bombs had a 19 inch piece of wood doweling attached, which could be inserted into a modified shotgun in order to launch the pipe bomb up to a hundred yards like a mortar. Jeez. Whoa, that is good Lord. Just bros doing their thing. That's some Van Helsing red neckery right there. You never been out in the country? Yeah, I just, you know, it just goes to show you if someone wants it bad enough, they'll figure it out. I mean, my God, putting wooden stakes and guns. Hey, I made a mortar. I figure we can shoot this bear. This explosive beer can Adam with a piece of wood inside of the gun. I was thinking about grilling fish. Uh, me too. Yeah. Same. I'm not going to talk out loud too much more. Okay. Which kind of fish did you want to get? Kind of has a policeman's heart. Okay. Sorry. Wait, what'd you ask? A salmon, whatever has the most of Magus. Uh, other, other, the pipe bombs, they would simply just throw. Sure. Some bombs when your arm gets tuckered out from overthrowing the government, some bombs were just filled with gasoline, taxes, incendiary devices, you know, so a month off cocktail 87, not 89. Get the cheap. Yeah, no, do not over. That's budgetary. That is budgetary conservatism right there. It all burns the same. That's right. That's right. That's right. They were prepared. You ever liked to rub barbed wire on your back or you? Yeah. Oh yeah. You ever put wig on a barbed wire? Yes. I may have made a woman out of barbed wire. That's what you know. When I told you accidentally bit a bottle in my mouth. That's why my tongue was so cut up. Yep. It's cause I was making out with the fence again. Okay. I'm going to show you my wiener. Oh man. I've been waiting for this moment. It does not look good. Look what I did. Oh boy. Whoa. That was fucked up. Bob wire looks like someone sucking up a mouthful of spaghetti. Yeah. Man, we're going to get the government for this. Yeah. I should say we are you and your tentacle cock. It's all tent. Squidman. They were prepared to quote go to war with the police if it came to that because on may 9th, Oh, this is, this is all as a defense because of the marijuana. Nope. No, it is a separate passion. They have two passions, growing a lot of weed in their side, their mystery magic shed. And then they also, that's a side side. We're getting into their main business. Okay. Now we're getting into the main job because on may 9th, they were planning to rob the security Pacific bank in Norco, California. Okay. Norco is short for North Corona. Sure. It was a semi rural residential town in Riverside County, about 50 miles or 800 or sorry, 80 kilometers east of the city of Los Angeles. It's a bit more built up now, but back then it was more rural. The men plan to use the money from the bank robbery to buy a piece of land where the government couldn't tell them what to do. Yeah. So that would be another country. Yes. Succession full on succession. Welcome to beer land. I'm going to buy land in America. So America can't tell me what to do. Take that America. Okay. Well there's no zoning for that here. What's zoning? Oh boy. Here we go. Now we got to blow up the zone in place. Boys. They had come with the plan just a week and a half before. So this is a new plan. Bank robbery. It's brand new. I would say this. Yeah. I think the key to a good bank robbery is catching your enthusiasm at its peak. Not the planning. I hear you. You just want to go in there when you're hot about the idea. The last thing you want to do is go in there when you're kind of like, we've got the tea gun, the plan. We've run through this so many times. It's not even fun anymore. That's right. It's getting a little boring. We're going to go. And then if there's die, then we do this. They prepared. They read up on military tactics, bought walkie talkies and Smith drew maps. Their preparation sounds like what a kid pretending a little half ass. I got the walkie talkies and I draw up plans. I drew a map. This one goes, look, that's the top is where the sea where the man is amazed from Long John Silver's. I know, but I'm fixing it. Yeah. I think it's pretty much the same. They trained with their weapons in Lytle Creek in the San Bernardino national forest and they brought in others. Harvins younger brother Russell, who was 27 and currently lived with his parents was on board. Okay. As were two brothers, Manny and Belisario Delgado, who were 21 and 17 years old. Wow. And you're 17. You're robbing a bank. I mean, God bless you. That's kind of, I think if you're going to rob a bank, you should do it around 13 or 14 because I get punished so much less. Once you're 18, you got to really think of life. Life is prison. Life is. Yeah. On May 9th, 1980, deputy Jim Evans stopped by his home as his wife, Mary was about to take the baby to the sitters and go to work. Mary said, quote, while I was getting ready for work, he gently held James on his knee, leaned over, kissed his cheek and looked at me. He said, you know, some men never get to see their sons grow up. Dave, what I don't like him saying that one. That day, Smith and Harbin went to a gas main at a building site in Norco. There they set an explosive device on the main. This was to go off later to be a distraction, which of all went according to plan, would attract the police and fire department while they were robbing the bank. Okay. At around the same time as Smith and Harbin planted the bomb, the other three men dressed in camouflage, military jackets and ski masks and carrying automatic weapons entered the Sears car park at the Brea mall. You guys validate sorry. Wait, we should have done this prior. You know, we're gonna get some coffee bicycles. Yeah. The man, dude, dude, dude, dude, washer dryer combo for 450. Holy shit. We got to come back here when we're not, when we're not doing this, we come back, get this. Can you hold that? Cause we got a thing to do. Don't give her your name, dude. And we're going to go to the security bank and then we'll be back. We'll come back. We'll come back when we're our own country. Do you take money would die on it? Do you guys take money from our country? American money, American dollars, because they're died dollars, hundreds. The men jumped out in front of a Dodge tradesman van that belonged to Gary Geraldo. They gagged and blindfolded Geraldo and shoved him in the back of the van. Then they loaded the van with weapons and bombs. I wish I didn't come to Sears today. Bad day to get a polyester suit. All five men then met up in Norco and got into the van and packed it with everything. Can you guys just take the van and leave me? That would be getaway car. Number one, they had left two other escape vehicles parked nearby, which they planned to switch to after robbing the bank. Okay. That's not a bad like it. Like it. They watch Starsky and Hutch. Liking it. Those two vehicles were also full of weapons. You got it. Listen, you got to pack every suitcase you're taking. I'm an analogy doctor. They then drove to the security Pacific bank on fourth and Hamner at 3 40 PM on Friday, the 9th of May, 1980. Just before the bank closed, the dark green van pulled into the parking lot outside of the bank, but the plan was already not going as expected. The explosive on the gas main at the building site on the other side of Norco did not go off a huge problem. An observant resident had noticed the burning fuse and reported it to the fire department. So no bomb going off for distraction. Well, at that point, don't you go, Hey, let's regroup another day tomorrow. Yeah, let's let's make sure we get our distraction. That was paramount in our planning. Yeah, the first phase of our plan. Well, so this means that the police will be on their normal routes. But they decided to go ahead with the robbery anyway. Interesting call. Why not? If you got it, you got all gussied up. The parking lot of the security security Pacific bank was full of cars, cars, people doing last minute Friday business, like before ATM says, well, sorry, I was an amazing time to think of. Oh, God, terrifying. Go get money and all the money I was going to buy, buy drugs for the weekend. Well, sorry, it was to be the driver. He remained in the van with a walkie talkie to report if you heard or saw anything. Wearing camo jackets, ski masks and carrying semiotic weapons. The other four men ran across the parking lot and into security Pacific bank. This was when another part of their amazing plan proved to have a flaw. Okay. Across the street at Redlands Federal Savings Bank, an employee watched the robbers in their gear running across the parking lot and immediately called the police. I was just gonna say, I mean, I feel like, I guess I've never really thought about how you go in the bank, but I feel like you don't make a cross now. You don't make it in the garb with the gun. You, you, you, you be a little more cash. You walk up. We don't wear camo. You walk, you don't wear camo. You also walk. What do you camouflage is to disguise yourself in the wild. Right. Nobody in a bank is going to be like, where did they go? No, that can happen. Where are they? That could, this happens all the time. Where the hell are they? They were here a minute ago. Ever heard of bank camo? It's got like phones. You just got like a vault wheel on your chest. Where is he? He was here a minute ago. No, you bring a duffel bag and then you change right in front of the bank. You throw the mask on. You do that. You pull out the gun. Yeah. They didn't do that. Okay. All right. Bad start. Meanwhile, inside security Pacific bank, someone hit a silent alarm as the four entered. Unfortunately, the signal was sent to Corona police department who then sent police to the Corona branch of the security Pacific bank. Okay. A break. That was five miles away from the bank that was actually being robbed. Okay. Thankfully, the Norco police department or it's not the Norco police department. It's the San Bernardino sheriff's Norco division. You know, the guys that are stationed there. Sure. So they've already sent sheriffs to the right bank due to the call from the witness across the street. Okay. So competing departments not good when you're robbing a bank in the bank, Manny Delgado jumped on the counter holding a 12 gig gauge shotgun. Russell Harbin guarded the door with an AR 15. George Smith gave the commands while he held an HK 91 and Chris Harbin with an HK 93 forced the bank manager to open the vault. The manager gave him all the cash. Okay, $20,000. Is that enough to start your own country? Now, I assume that either they didn't know that this bank was a rural bank, so it didn't have a lot of money, or the robbing in on a day when a lot of money had been picked up. Again, these are homework questions. They are totally homework questions. That's why you don't do it in a week. Smith had Sure, we've got $400 all in $2 bills. What? What does he fuck? We'll take it. We'll take Yeah, give us all of that. Smith that Smith that account at the bank and had cased it but obviously hadn't worked out that it didn't have much cash. So 25 year old Riverside County Deputy rookie Glenn Bielanski was around the corner from the bank when he got the call of a 211 in progress. A 211 or a 211. He responded immediately without his siren on just as lights on. Interesting. Belisario Delgado saw him approaching and radio telling his fellow criminals to get out of the bank. Hey dummies. Hey guys, it's on. As he drove, Deputy Bielanski heard popping sounds like glass bottles. At first he thought it was a red was the red light bar in his car. He had taken the car to the garage superintendent in the morning to have it replaced because the solid red bar light was out. So he assumed that's what the noise was. The cop thought it was his what he's hearing pop pop pop. But why is he why is he going to the bank with a siren on because he knows about he turned he knows he's a robber around but he turned the siren on. Okay, get my crazy to think that that's a little to be like, what is all that shooting noise coming from my siren? Look, you don't when you're getting shot at you don't ever expect to be shot at. You're a cop on his way to a robbery. But it doesn't even matter. You're boy that he sounds like Steve Martin and the jerk with the cans. Well, first of all, this is this sirens really shooting. This is before before we have what we have now. These guys have fucking handguns and shotguns. They're they're not thinking they're getting shot at by automatic weapons. Okay, so your point is that automatic weapons is what's throwing him? Oh, totally. Okay. Okay, I buy that if he was if he saw a guy shooting with a handgun, he's gonna be really close, right? But he's a fucking couple hundred yards away. Okay, and he's getting hit to him. That doesn't so it's more the type of gun rather than shooting in general. Okay, all right. I can buy that. So I accept your apology. Yeah. What? In this case, what happened was Bellasario had stepped out of the van and started shooting. Okay. Belaski now ducked as his windshield was that does he get a pay bump because now he's a shooter to driver shooter. I think that's based on the planning. I don't think they probably went through pay bumps. Okay. What's their union status? He's still in the union. Okay, good. His windshield is blown out at this point and now he is 20 to 30 yards away. Then he pulls into the bank parking lot and he finds himself pointed straight at the other four bank robbers who were just 15 feet away standing in the parking lot with their weapons and they started fire awkward. The noise was deafening as his windows were shattered by the air. The sirens going haywire case. Man, I'm gonna have to pay for this. Oh boy. Oh boy. Belaski quote, for a quick second. I thought this isn't real people with machine guns shooting at me people with hooded ski masks wearing khaki green jackets firing at me. This can't be real. The men fired into his car and blast he was hit in the left shoulder as well as taking fragments in the arm and face. Now he knew it was real. I started to think they're firing at me. I started thinking a bullet. I mean that this is some things at first he thought about driving his car into them but he quickly realized that if he did that he would only be able to take out one. His tires were then blown out by the guns. So Belaski dove under the dashboard through his car in reverse and drove it out into the street ramming into a parked car on the opposite side of four street. His car spun around in perfect position to use as a shield against the bullets. Belaski said his brain was now in superdrive. Oh yeah. So he fucking went into commode. Yeah. Finally. Well Belaski grabbed his shotgun and got out of the car. All right guys. Here we go fuckers. Okay. And crouched behind the front wheel of his car. Let me get this musket. Time. Timeout. The gang piled into their van through the back door. The van then drove out of the car park and as they did they had to pull out pass Belaski's car. At this point there was no shooting. Belaski said it was definitely quiet. He felt like it was happening in slow motion. He got up stepped out and shot the only four rounds he had in his shotgun at the back of the van. One pellet hit the driver Belisario in the back of the head. Well that's instantly paralyzing. That's a big shot right there. Yeah that's probably your best shot at this point that you can make. That's some shit. Kill the driver. Another pellet hit George Smith in the groin. Jesus. Okay so. One headshot and one dick shot. Jeez. Just like they teach at the academy. Belaski watched as the van weaved and then crashed into a chain link fence. Okay. Two shots left. Not bad. Yeah. There should be a show right now called Belaski. Listen he's in one one guy's genetic history has ended and then another one's too. So we can't reproduce these robbers. He threw his shotgun away. Ran it because they only had four shells. They only had four shells. Oh okay. So he's okay. He didn't he didn't just go yeah. Yeah. And then spike it. Yeah okay yeah. Woo. Daddy's on a hot streak. He threw the shotgun away ran and curled around the front tire with his revolver figuring the endron block could protect him. The four still alive robbers got out of the van grabbed as many explosives and guns as they could carry. Then standing for breast they started firing their automatic weapons. Okay. Belaski radioed help me help me to live in progress. They've got automatic weapons. Get some backup quick. Seriously. He's been there for a while. No he hasn't. No. This is all happening. It's so fucking fast. Other officers listening could hear the terror in his voice. Now you pranking us. Okay. So there's gonna be so many cops involved now. So if you get confused just ask me okay. Okay. I was originally going to call him cop one and cop two and cop three but then I thought that's totally unfair. Okay. Yes these guys actually went through some fucking crazy shit. Yeah. Sorry my co-host can't remember stuff so your memory dies with your memory dies with the news trades. This is another another part of Smith and Harvin's plan showed itself to be not that great. Okay. Usually in narco there were only two cop cars on duty but this was change over time so that meant there were actually three. I mean not not I mean they picked the worst time. Yeah they couldn't have they couldn't have done this worse on every level. Everything went poorly. Everything was bad. Okay. Deputy Andy Delgado was one of them. He drove up on Hamler Avenue on the opposite side of the van as Balansky Delgado also only had a service revolver and a shotgun making him woefully overpowered by the automatic weapons. Meanwhile Balansky moved back to the front seat of his car to get more ammo for his revolver and was shot in the elbows of his right arm severing an artery. He was also hit in the face and both forms by shrapnel. Nice and they continue firing his car as fire. His car ended up having 47 bullet holes in it. So the car didn't make it. Car did not make it. Yeah. We'll talk about that later. Yeah. Then the third unit arrived at the scene driven by Deputy Chuck Hill. He turned onto the street and saw Balansky's car turned sideways and the rookie behind it taking fire. Quote I heard two loud pops. My God those are bullets hitting my car. I realized they were shooting at me. The dinosaur PD. In training officers are trained to take evasive action, pull away and secure themselves. So that's what he did. He pulled behind a little building in a field to the side of the bank. As he did, he heard Balansky screaming on the radio, my God, my God, I'm shot. Please help me. The suspects are stranded. Their vehicles disabled on Hamler and forth. A little help here. I need an ambulance. I'm bleeding badly. So Hill knew he had to get to Blansky right away. He left his car and ran across the dirt field figuring without his car he would make less of a target. Interesting. That's fucking interesting. That's fucking crazy balls at shit. That's pretty tough. I'm going out the car fuckers. I can stop the bullets. Bingo. They'll know I'm coming that way. He just fucking ran across the field. Okay. As he did, they shot at him. Quote, they were shooting from the hip and lucky lucky for me they were lousy shots. When he got to Blansky, the rookie was in shock. He was cold and covering the elbow wound with his other hand. Hill kneeled down and Blansky told him his gun wasn't loaded. So he'll took the handgun and reload it for him. Then put the gun back in his left hand. Like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance fucking kid. Jesus. At this point, Hill had not seen the suspects. He just been shot at. He actually hadn't seen them. Right. He asked Blansky where they were. Blansky said they were moving around a lot. Good helpful. So Hill said we need to get out of here. They're not going away. There was a big tree behind them and he'll figure the bullets couldn't get through the tree. So he asked Blansky if he could make it and Blansky said I think so. Oh my god. So they ran for it. As they ran, he'll had his hand over Blansky's bleeding elbow. They ran for the tree and made it. I really want to see that. Yeah. Guy holding another guy's elbow. Yeah. He probably chewed down because they were like, what's going on there? Is he holding his elbow? Are they playing elbow game? What's happening? Hey guys, we're not doing an elbow run. The gunman then turned all their attention on Deputy Delgado. Oh, cool. He was like, cool. Good. Great guys. You guys are going to go. That gave Hill the chance to run back to his unit and as he ran, he said he thought it sounded like Vietnam. Now Blansky was alone behind the tree watching the four men fire at Deputy Delgado's car. Then some dude just walked up behind Blansky and said, Hey, what's going on? Whoa, sir, sir, sir. What's doing bro? Your elbow hurt? Hey man, why y'all bloody and stuff? These guys are shooting at us. These guys, they robbed a bank. They're shooting at us. You should get down. You want a coke? I got some guys. Get down. You idiot. You want some cola bro? No, my elbow shut off. Blitz. You like sports? You like sports? My buddy has got tickets to, um, uh, oh, what was, who's in town? Oh my God. I can't fight. No, it wasn't the gun fight. It was. No, no, no. Hold on. It'll come to me. God, I'm bleeding out. No, that ain't it either. Who is they? Oh no, it's a concert. Yeah. My buddies. Do you like the police? Do you like the police? I didn't even think they were around yet. Huh? No, I'm talking about cops, police in general. You ever heard of them? Yup. Yeah. What about the who? I don't like that. Uh, so the guy, you know, I heard about a bank robbery going on around here. I was just wondering if you heard of anything. You're in it. You're in it. You're in it. This is it. You're in it. Anyway, if you need concert tickets, we should exchange info. Thank you. We're a little busy over here. Yeah. All right. I'm probably just going to go to the pet store, get some food or whatever. All right. Well, I should get moving. So tired. I'm not sleeping good lately. It's just too hot. Why is this guy in every dollop? Why is there always a guy that does something weird in every dollop? There's a, I'm reading that. I told like someone was like, Hey, can I do a research? This guy, Gareth Gareth did research. And I said, yeah, I gave him a story like a month ago and I'm reading it. I'm like, wait, the guy came up and just said, Hey, what are you doing? So what else is up? We're in a gunfight. This tree is huge. Huge fucking tree, man. Think I could climb this. Oh my God. So Blansky looked at the idiot and said, if you don't lay down now, you're a dead man. And then the guy just took off. Oh man. You got some attitude. What a dick. Jeez. Got cops with dicks. You're right. I went to this cop and I was like, how you doing? He goes, get out of here. You're going to die. I was like, fuck whatever. Whatever, dude. Later punk. Hill drove back serpentine style and swung the car around. The back door was already open and Blansky fell into the back seat. He'll said, quote, I'm going to floor this, get you around the corner and then we'll put your feet in and he'll hit the gas driving off with Blansky's legs dangling out of the car. I mean, if you're watching this, you're like, what movie are they making? Who is that? It's crazy movies. That is crazy. And sure enough, that's the day they got, they got behind some cover and he pulled them in and then they jumped to Corona community hospital where the staff was waiting with a new elbow with a new elbow. Now the robbers were only barely threatened by deputy Delgado's ineffective fire because he was so far away and he'd been hit. The four robbers grabbed a bunch of explosives and ammunition from their van. How much longer until the cab's here? They left $20,000 in cash. Okay. So a net nothing. Net nothing. They left 2000 rounds of ammunition and 15 homemade bombs. They also left Greg Geraldo. They overpacked. They totally overpacked. Yeah. Okay. You know what? Overpacked. Yeah. You got to know what your limits are. Yeah. Our eyes were bigger than our tummies. I wonder if they said goodbye to Greg. Bye. Thanks for the van. The four bank robbers ran toward a yellow pickup truck that had stopped at a red light on the northbound lane of Hamner. The driver seeing four guys running out of him in ski masks and carrying automatic weapons. You guys hit in the slopes. Got the fuck out of his truck, leaving the engine running. They go and ran into a Carl's junior across the street. Can I get a junior Western? Hey, I shall take a sourdough. Smith and Russell Harvin jumped in the back of the pit. What if he didn't even know there was a robbery? He just wanted Carl's juniors. Anytime this guy sees a Carl's junior, he gets out of his truck. He reps to it. Whoa, baby. Robbery? What robbery? They just took your truck. Oh, I don't care. Do not care. Chicken tenders. How are those? Oh, I didn't know you guys carry those now. You guys do fish. So Smith and Russell Harvin jumped in the back of the pickup. Manny Delgado and Chris Harvin got in the front. They took off northbound in the yellow truck. It was a 1969 truck. Not very fast, but very sturdy. Okay. They drove down the street right past Delgado's car and fired at him. Delgado couldn't load his revolver because he was wounded. They missed him as they drove past firing. And then Delgado grabbed the radio and said that the gang had split up and taken hostages. I think they're moving to the country. One of them is a bat. The other one's a donkey. Delgado, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. I've, I've gained a lot of blood. How many of you guys are birds? Huh? So he says that they have taken hostages and that they've split up. None of which is true. Interesting intel. So now there's confusion about whether or not some of the suspects had remained near the bank and everyone thought there were hostages in the truck. One of them's a merman and the other one's cotton candy. They got bazookas. They got bazookas and they're driving a big hockey skate. Okay. Over and out. Oh, and it's a hot air balloon too. We're good. We're good with reports Delgado. Thank you. And every time it moves, it shoots taffy. Okay. Thank you officer Delgado. You'll know it's the one because it's playing the entertainer on a loop. Okay. We will talk to you later. Radio silence. Thank you. All right. Good luck. They're all chipmunks now. They just changed. Okay. Okay. Thank you. There's 450 of them. All right. Thank you. All right. I'm made of wire. Let's keep the radio quiet. Call me Dr. Billiards. Okay. Billiards ambulance will be there in a minute. Ah, Jacques Cousteau is my best friend. Okay. Can I? I pee ketchup. Hey, why don't you head over to Carl's Jr.? Well, say no more. Chicken tenders. The total amount of time since the shooting began was? No. Come on. Yes. I mean, I, I'll because I know it's not long. I guess I'll say 20 minutes for what? What? That's how fast this shit happens. Four minutes. Four minutes. I mean, that's a commercial break. Wow. Four minutes. Yeah. Jeez. That flew by. Man, when you get shot at it really goes quick. So now cops from all over are pouring into the area. Corona and Riverside Sheriff's, Riverside PD and the highway patrol. Shit was on. The robbers drove the truck northbound on Hamner heading out of Narco. As they did, they ran two red lights and hit two cars. Well, at that point. Yeah. I mean, what the fuck? Yeah. They drove toward a deputy read who was driving in the opposite direction and unloaded on his car, putting a bullet in his knee. They drove past their two getaway cars, which they had planned to switch to and make their escape. They were an AMC ambassador and a Chevy Camaro. See the Camaro would have been fucking sweet. No time, though. In those cars was an H and H Magnum rifle, which is also known as an elephant gun. There was also extra ammo and camping equipment. OK, so they had plans. Sure. Go camping after. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, you want to roast some marshmallows. Some wieners around the fire. Yeah, for sure. And hot dogs. But they could not stop and make the switch because of all the cops after them. Yeah. So the plan's totally not happening. Has the plan happened at all? Nope. Yeah. And the gang then continued to drive north, then turn east where they came across Deputy Borden in front of a dairy farm. Smith and Russell Harbin fired from the bed of the pickup, missing Borden completely, but forcing him off the road. He crashed into the dairy farm. OK. I mean, now it's like now we're just kind of hitting our montage stuff. But they were now on residential streets of Mira Loma where their home was. Uh huh. The pickup next came across Deputy Rolf Parks, who had pulled up onto the shoulder with the right side of his car up against a horse corral. Parks said the driver was looking right at him and driving onto the shoulder. Park stayed in his car and made himself as small as he could. Presto shrinko quote. They drove by and started shooting the crap out of my car. Four guys were shooting at me. Bullets were striking metal, breaking glass, glass flying all over. He thought he was going to be killed. One bullet ricocheted and grazed his head. He also later realized that a piece of glass had stuck in his right eye. Oh, later. You got to be on some adrenaline if you later realize glasses in your eye. What's that? Oh, it's a big thing. A glass. What about your eye? Oh, I hadn't even noticed. Oh, look, that's huge. Uh, but he wasn't about to stop after they passed. Parks turned his car around and went in pursuit. This is I mean, that's just they are bad ass. They started shooting at him again. He said the bullets hitting the ground sounded like the crack of a bullwhip. He also used the radio to tell other cops a piece of information no one had heard yet. The criminals were using high powered weapons. Right. Okay. Yes. As the suspects turned north, they found deputy Herman Brown driving right at them on the opposite side of the road. The two vehicles met in front of a busy supermarket and as was their thing, they fired on Brown. Right. Behind them, Parks watched as they shot up the car glass exploding everywhere and then drove off. Parks was sure Brown would be dead. But when he pulled up, Brown had only been shot in the leg. Wow. They really were not good shots. They shot at people in the leg though. They're good leg shooters. They're great at legs. Yeah. Appendages. They're killing their fucking fuck up an appendage. Yeah. Yeah. The elbow killers. I mean, look, I don't think I've never shot an automatic weapon, but I assume they're hard to aim. Sure. But you would also assume that if you were robbing a bank and you had all these weapons, you'd probably be, you know, it's quality, not quantity. Well, they took them up to Lytle Canyon and they did a little creek and they tried. They tested them out. They did training. Yeah. No. I mean, shooting into a creek is a lot like a high stakes bank robbery. Very much the same. So Parks kept going as he did a bullet hit his windshield dead center. They continued north and now Riverside, a Riverside PD helicopter joined the chase above them. Okay. So at this point, if you're in the truck, you're like, well, things aren't good. Now this is pre like they didn't have the technology to have a helicopter flying above watching a chase. Okay. This is pre that. So what is the helicopter? It's just a Riverside PD helicopter, but it's not, how's it going on the ground guys? There's no news helicopters. There's no, I see what you're saying. Right. Right. Okay. Uh, at an intersection, two Riverside PD officers, Wayne McDaniels and David Madden moved to intercept the truck and the guys in the truck opened fire. They, Dale was shot in the shoulder and a hail of bullets and Madden was not shot. So he continued the chase. All the radio calls from the cars out on the street were now creating chaos. There was so much gunfire and so many offers officers getting shot that it was hard to make sense of what the fuck was going on. I'm sure. Yeah. It had been four and a half minutes. I've been shot. I've been shot. No, I've been shot. Anyone dead? No, nobody's dead. We've all, but we all think I'm dead. No, no, no. You're talking about talking to the, no, no, no. We're, we've all been, how many people have been shot in the legs? I'm a hammer. Thank you. Deputy Delgado. I just want to let everyone know I'm Zeus's. I'm Zeus's best friend. Uh, if someone could come over here and help me, I'm opening a pizza store. I need all the help I could get. I got a lot of sauce here on the floor. Uh, and everyone say hello to my wife, a basketball. This is when the gang started launching, launching homemade pipe bombs. Ah, fun. Might as well take it up a notch. You may as well. At this point, Parks and Madden slowed down their cars to keep some distance between them and the pickup. Okay. It wasn't just because of the bombs, but also the automatic weapons. Madden radio. Always a good sentence. Madden radioed. We're going to have to lay back cause of the amount of rounds they're firing at us. CHP cars then joined the chase. As they did, Parks looked at his engine dials and saw they were all dead. The front end of the card sank. The car was toast killed by rifle fire, but Parks wasn't done and he grabbed his shotgun. A deputy Frank Chisholm picked him up and they continued the chase. That's awesome. I fucking love that. Need a lift? Yeah, baby. Let's go. Uh, as they did, they came across what Parks would describe as quote, a graveyard of police cars, four lined up in a row, all shot to hell. There were two police cars, two CHP cars, and a bunch of civilian cars. An officer Reynard had been shot in the elbow. Another officer had a bullet whizzed by his head. More elbow shots. Elbows, arms. They don't like, they don't like a bendy part. Did they maybe just think that people bled out through elbows more than they do? That's what they were trained. They were trained to... Some great elbow shots, gentlemen. These guys wouldn't have made it out of here alive. I think that guy's going to be able to hit a jump shot again. You guys nicely avoided the hearts. Part of our goal. The truck was driving north and then turn onto East 50th street. Okay. They were on the street that Smith and Harvin lived on. Oh boy. In a few seconds they drove past their own house. A neighbor watched them drive by. Hey Trent. Quote, shooting with policemen on their tails. It was quite a big deal. Yeah. Okay. Said the man who doesn't know how to state the truth. It was really quite a scene. It was something I'll tell you right here. Definitely the most exciting thing I've seen on a Saturday this month. George is that wow. Look at that. We should lay down. The gang then decided on a new tactic. Divert the cops by trying to kill or wound innocent bystanders. Oh, well that's when you're getting kind of shady. They hope the cops would have to stop the strangers elbows to help to stop the wounded. They shot at a car disabling it. Then they turned on a bank street, a residential street and saw a group of 12 year olds riding their bikes. Okay. So I mean they had to stare morality in the eye. Yeah. All right. We got to shoot it. Boy, that's a bunch of cute kids on bikes. This screams of math, doesn't it? Yeah. They shot at the children with their automatic weapons. Somehow they only hit one kid who was shot in the finger. Dave. I mean, I mean, look, it's a bummer. What is the point of getting hollow point bullets if they're not going to break anyone's skin? Really? If it's a bummer that a 12 year old was shot, but it, but in the finger, like I'm saying that's the best scenario. Yeah. Or it's insane. Maybe the hair. I mean, honestly, what like completely insane. I think I got a guy's finger. All right guys, we're chipping away at this. Good luck flipping somebody off. You son of a bitch. Yeah. You'll have to use your left hand to indicate that in future. Damn it. They then began throwing their explosives at passing civilian automobiles. Messed up. One deputy yelled over his radio quote, they are throwing all sorts of stuff. There's bombs and teddy bears and a brick. They turned back down to 50th street and drove past their house again. Maybe just getting a look, maybe like, man, goodbye. Looks great. Maybe let's see if they close the gate. Sure. Yeah. Guys, the garage is open. No. Yes. I told you. All right. Let's swing back around. Hurry up. Deputy John Sellas was in an undercover police car when he spotted the truck and started pursuing over the radio. He said, quote, they've got hoods on and I just saw them put another clip in a weapon. I love that. That guy's like, yeah, not, not that useful of information. Yeah. They have hoods on and I think they're going to be shooting more. They're reloading. Uh, another officer noted that they were very professional with military backpacks, gas masks and military type ban banana ammo clips. Anyone watching would have seen two men in back of the truck shooting and throwing bombs with another hanging out the passenger window shooting. Geez. They decided to get out of town and drove onto highway 60 westbound and then onto I-15 north parks and Chisholm were in one unit behind them and deputy sales was in another. As they drove their windshields were being hit with bullets. San Bernardino PD helicopter King 40, King one entered the fray flying above the truck. The gunman weren't thrilled about it and shot at it. One bullet deflected, came through the floor between the copilot's legs and hit the instrument panel, which then caught on fire. Oh boy. The helicopter was forced to land. The number of pursuers, did he get a hang nail? The number of pursuing police kept growing in size. Riverside County deputies were joined by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's office, the California Highway Patrol and officers from multiple. So it's the blues brothers. Yeah, it's the, it's totally the blues fucking brothers. The gang Nazis, the gang kept up a deadly stream of rifle fire from the rear of the truck, forcing the pursuing officers to fall back hundreds of yards. Despite maintaining a half mile distance from the pickup, they were still being hit by gunfire. Fortunately there wasn't much traffic on the highway, but that also meant the cops were taking all the fire. Uh, parks requested all pursuing units to keep their lights off as it made them an obvious target over the radio. The deputies were talking. They might be low on ammo or hear rounds to find rounds of this. Now we got to figure out what we have to do. Wait until they run out of ammo. Totally. The police were always in range of the rifle armed felons who could engage them with impunity while remaining outside the reach of the cops revolvers. Then one cop car, uh, overtook the lead vehicles and drove close to the suspects. Okay. Who immediately threw three bombs at it. Okay. That was the end of that idea. Alrighty. Good try. It was a good try. This guy was like, fuck this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to put an end to this right now. I see my name in lights. Alrighty. Move away. They're throwing MGD cans that are bombs. Taking this back. The pickup now exited I-15 and entered the sand. I wonder if it's signaled. Uh, it's always fun to picture that. I would. Instinct just still kicks in. I bet it does a little bit. A little bit. I bet it does. Uh, so they entered the San Bernardino national forest and as they did, they shut up another sheriff's car to save them. They're heading back to Lytle Creek. Mechanics in the city were probably like had dollars, cartoon dollar signs in their eyes. This is going to be great. Boy, they really blew up a lot of cars. We are loving it. It's us and the elbow surgeon who are going to be laughing all the way to this bank. What about one of those guys who pulls up? Have you ever done it in your car? Oh, the best. One of those guys who just followed the cops around, hey man, you need me to fix that? No, no. 25 bucks? No, no. You guys always use the wrong color. No, I'll do it really quick. 25 bucks. No, no. Just do it. Pop it right out. No, no, no. My buddy, my buddy got that done. Like some dude in a parking lot was like, fuck up your car. He was just, he like, when he saw the guy, he was like, I mean, this is terrible. And the guy was like, that's pretty good. And he was like, it's a totally different color. They, they completely fuck up your car. The same guy one time came out to his car in a parking lot and someone had drawn with their key, a huge cock on his hood and he said he dropped to his knees and went, no. Uh, so they're going to where they did the training in Lytle Creek. They drove on a dirt road toward a Canyon. So far they've driven 35 miles in 42 minutes. Okay. Meanwhile, a deputy from San Bernardino trying to get to the scene got his car stuck on a train crossing and was struck by a Union Pacific freight train. The car flew a hundred yards. They really are making a movie. The patrol car was destroyed. The deputy was not hurt. Parks and Chisholm followed, but it's almost like the GI Joe cartoon where nobody died. It's fucking insane. I mean, except for the two bad guys. Parks and Chisholm, if you assume to me, losing your penis is as good as death. Parks and Chisholm followed, but their car taking a lot of shots. The radiator started to heat up and steam began pouring out. Now the AC is not even working. They began losing power. The car was slowly dying. Chisholm kept his foot full on the accelerator, but it just chugged along. Sad. Then it died. A new, uh, new law enforcement car took the lead. Deputy Evans. Okay. Who's he? He's our, he's our cop with the baby. Okay. Right. Parks and Chisholm watched all the other cars fly past them heading up into the mountains. They were all wondering what they could do against these guys. If the chase stopped, the cops were completely overpowered except for one. A San Bernardino deputy named McCarthy was getting off duty when he heard the shooting start. He remembered there was an M 16 in the armory and grabbed it. He now had it in his car, but he had no idea how to use it. Oh, well it doesn't sound like that stopped the criminals. He was, it would be great if this was just ended with those, the cop not knowing how to shoot and then just shooting each other from 10 yards away missing. He was part of the pack chasing the truck to Lytle Creek. A second helicopter joined three. Our patrol officers were just behind Evans Sergeant Bender and detective Hopkins were also in pursuit in an undercover drug unit. Some distance by an Evans. They had only a car with a radio that could communicate. They were the only car with a radio that could communicate with the helicopter. Okay. Due to a difference in radio frequencies, the helicopter could not make contact with the riverside patrol units. Okay. So, so deputy Evans could not receive the helicopter broadcast because his car radio did not pick up the helicopters, California law enforcement, mutual aid radio. Oh boy. But the two undercover cops had a handheld radio that could get the signal CCL is working good. Yeah, really, really well. So the helicopter would radio down the location of the gang's truck to the undercover car who would hear it over their handheld radio and then they would use their car radio to radio Evans. But at the same time all these cops are talking over the radio. Yeah, it's eventually going to be like telephone. Yeah, it's a fucking they're right near that blue barn. Even if it's not, he said he's right near the do far. Oh God, there's no do far there. He said, don't worry, there's no harm. He said his favorite thing is a nice charm. He said they're stopping for shawarma. Okay, they're at a Greek place getting shawarma to the Greek shop to the Greek shop. You're unimpressed with my creativity. I liked it. So then the truck hit a washed out part of the dirt road. That was it. The gang stopped and gave me like a part of the dirt road that used to have a promising career but then kind of just packed it all in and that doesn't do much. That road is washed. No one cared anymore. Had its peak. They stopped and got out of the truck and waited in ambush for the cops to come around the bend. Evan was figured this was happening. He radioed back. Looks like they're going to lay back on a curb and wait for us the helicopter radio down that they had gotten out of the truck and were waiting. The sergeant and the drug cart tried to warn Evans but it didn't go through. Wow. Because all the other cops are probably talking. Yeah. Quote dispatcher Evans, are you okay? Evans. Yeah, I'm okay. There's a blind curb up ahead and I don't know how far back we are. Have radio advised the chopper to keep a lookout. Tell them if they stop. We are telling you. We want to know. We are coming on a big curve. What are they doing? Are they moving? Evans unit around the corner and was immediately hit by several bullets. His windshield shattered. The interior of the car disintegrated. Evans. Okay, I'm hit. Then Evan screamed. Deputy Park saw some civilian target shooters walking around. He stopped the car and ran up to them telling them I need your rifle. We're following some cop killers. All the cops at this point believe several officers had been killed during the chaos. Because of course if you're driving by and you see some guys shooting at a car, you think your buddy's dead. Yeah, and you probably think a bunch of 12 year olds died, not that a kid lost the middle finger. Right. One of the target shooters gave him his 22 and all his ammo. Not a great. Yeah. Not a great gun to bring to this fight. Yeah. Here's the worst thing you could have. Here's my crossbow. I have some throwing stars. Here we are. And this is a hat. I've got a slingshot and some larger sized pebbles. Parks then ran back to the car and they continued the pursuit. The road was made for cars to go 10 miles an hour and they were doing 50. Parks tried to load the rifle while the car kept going airborne. Wow. Parks came to us. The parks car came to a stop in the road and could see the exchange of gunfire between Evans and the gang. They were about a quarter mile away. The cops shot, but as it had been the entire afternoon, they were outgunned under fire. Evans got out of his unit and crawled around back using the patrol car for cover against the automatic fire. Evans somehow returned seven shots with his service revolver from 56 yards. Wow. Evans was a Vietnam veteran who had served as a lieutenant in the green beret. Okay. He's a fucking bad. Sure. So this is a guy that's like, uh, I'll take my pistol. Yeah. Whip it out. He reloaded his revolver and set to shoot at the game, but was then shot to the eye and died instantly. Oh man. That's terrible. Yeah. But we knew that from when I started and foreshadowed, I kind of was thinking that that was maybe like a false foreshadow. Well, cause I was, yeah, I thought maybe at the end of this it'd be like, and he's going to kiss his boy. Good night that night. But, uh, instead of pull it one through his eye to his brain. So the car between parks unit was, uh, the heart, sorry, the car, but behind parts unit was McCarthy who had the M 16. He sped past them. I was actually hoping Evans was going to get the M 16. Yeah. You're right. Yeah. Deputy DJ McCarthy rounded the corner just in time to see Evans fall. They also got some records I could spin if we need that. Oh, that yes. Come on. They've entered and fired at McCarthy was hit in the right arm. He stopped crawled out of the car over the driver's seat seat. They started walking down the hill and firing him. The shooting was so insane that he tried to dig a hole in the ground. Wow. I'm just going to go down. I'm going to be bare grills for a minute. Go down here. Ah, I'm going to try to get to China before you guys get to me. Then he realized that his only chance of survival was to get the M 16 and shoot back. Yes. He grabbed it out of his car and took a look at it and figured out how to use it. Triggered and then he popped up on the hood. He popped up. He put it down on the hood of the car and squeezed the trigger. This changed the game completely. Oh, sure. Now the gang realized the police had the same level of firepower and they ran away. Okay. Off into the woods of Mount Baldy, leaving most of their ammo behind. If not for that gun, there would have been a lot more dead cops on the road that day. Soon around 200 police officers arrived in the forest and they headed up. One local paper called it the manhunt on Mount Baldy. SWAT teams from San Bernardino spent the rest of the night in a Lytle Creek in freezing temperatures. The LA pretty brought a 65 man team on the hunt. Several helicopters and local law enforcement teams scoured the hillside. Probably morale is probably low with the bank robbers now. Yeah. The following morning, Chris and Russell Harvin were found huddled together and shivering from the freezing night temperatures. They gave up without resistance. Chris Harvin had been shot by deputy Evans in the back. Okay. Okay. So the guy with the fucking stud with the fucking pistol shot the fucking dude. Yeah. Russell Harvin was carrying three handguns when he was arrested. George Wayne Smith gave himself up on officers near his hiding place. He was suffering from a gunshot wounds to the left leg and of course the groin. He had lost a lot of blood. Manny Delgado had climbed up a hill adjacent to Mount Baldy trying to avoid detection, but he was spotted. When the police got to him, he was hiding in the bush. He turned gun in hand and was immediately filled with many shotgun pellets. He somehow managed to also shoot himself in the heart during the exchange. Hmm. You're a real villain when you're turning on yourself. Let me help you. I'm sad they only killed one of them. Yeah. Two. They killed two. Well, and a dickless one. A dick. One guy lost again. I really think that that guy's I mean when that guy gets out, he's not, you know, like he's not like, Hey, it's great to be alive. He's like, it's this was a bad idea. What are they just going to give me a bump like the Ken doll? I didn't know dicks were a possibility of going away. He's really the Norco bank robbery shootout is still one of the biggest gunfights with police in American history. The battle between law enforcement and five heavily armed Orange County criminals lasted over 50 miles from the security Pacific bank in the foothills of the, uh, to San Bernardino national forest. The gang fired over 2000 rounds and launched several homemade bombs. They damaged or destroyed 33 patrol cars, shot down a sheriff's helicopter, wounded eight officers, killed several civilians, sorry, injured several civilians and killed Riverside County sheriff's deputy James Evans. But Jake and Elwood were okay. Jake and I were fine. The trial of George Wayne Smith and the Harbin brothers was moved to Vista due to Riverside media coverage. It still took 14 months to choose a jury and try the case. I don't get that. I don't get why you can't like in a situation like that, why do you need to move? Like shouldn't why you need it? Cause too many people know about it and have already already prejudiced. I know. I guess I'm being anti-constitutional by that statement, but it's, um, yeah, it's a jury. Your peers, your peers are people that heard about it. I don't know. I get it. But you know, remember OJ? Yeah, he's having a high year by the way. Big year for the judge. Uh, so they were all found guilty 44 counts each. Um, in September, 1982, Smith and the Harbin brothers were sentenced to life plus 36 years. One of my favorite sentences is when you sentenced them to life plus more time. Yeah. Fuck. It's a great, yeah. Hey, when you're dead, we're going to keep your body in here. Well, that seems a little, that's what's happening. Sorry. Uh, law enforcement agencies in California soon came up with more substantial reforms. The Norco robbery was a wake up call for Southern California law enforcement agencies. They realized heavily armed coordinated groups of deadly opponents were effective life. Um, they were also preparing for the 1984 Olympic games and concerned about terrorism. And after Narco a rapidly accelerating war against heavily armed drug cartels, um, they realized that the outfit patrol officers with long range, powerful weapons, uh, law enforcement agencies re-avided their weapons policies. The Sam Bernadette or sheriff's department soon made the Ruger mini 14 to 23 semi-automatic rifle standard equipment for its deputies and the highway patrol followed suit. The technology in 1980 did not allow for news cameras to broadcast in 1997. The technology did allow that. And that is probably why the North Hollywood bank robbery got so much more attention than Narco by 1997. The department of defense had established the 1033 program to transfer surplus M 16 rifles to law enforcement and they accepted them and snapped them up in 1980 police helicopters just for observation and personal delivery. But after the Norco copter was shot down, departments undertook training to teach air to ground small arms return fire. This would prove to be a very successful strategy in lethal force encounters in later years. So this really, the Norco shootout was a big part of the militarization of police in America. A public shooting range has been built at Lytle Creek. The security bank, uh, Pacific security Pacific bank sits empty, a chain link fence surrounding the building. It has been nearly two and a half years since the city council voted to permit horse race wagering at a future restaurant called Striders there. The developers sport tech venues, California are nearly two years past their initial completion date and say, quote, we think Narco is going to be a great place to do business. Deputy Guy Balansky received the sheriff's gold hearts, the equivalent of the military's purple heart and the medal of courage for his heroic actions. That day he has traveled across the country delivering seminars on responding to high stress incidents. He never fired a weapon again. Well, please say the motivation of the robbers was simple quote, sheriff's detectives, Larry Mainberg, their bank robbers, because for the most part they were all unemployed and did not have any money. Well, at least that changed. People try to set it up. They were like survivalists and white power and all shit, but they're just fucking unemployed losers really is crazy though, because the amount of things you just listed off there, I mean, you know, like, especially with the time we live in now where I had an argument with a guy on Facebook the other day, somebody that's weird, somebody that I don't know. That's a people should know. So I left Twitter because I just think people are fucking too nasty. Right. And I'm, I hate what I'm seeing with the way that fucking disintegration of shit. Sure. And on Facebook, I realized that anybody can see your comments and just leave comments. I thought that everyone on Facebook could have their own page and only people you knew could leave comments. Oh, right. Well, that's weird. People who don't follow you on there can leave comments. Yeah. But how do they even see your stuff? Someone else. So like, oh, because someone will comment and then it'll be like, so and so commented on Dave Anthony's right. Right. Okay. Yeah. So then you're able to get the full like the whole I just make fun of them and then block them. But so you were fighting with some guy. Well and they're you know, the I mean, it's like, part of the problem is that we're in such a quagmire with guns, that the the argument that was being presented was one of you know, we really like this is not a gun issue. This is a mental health issue. No, it's all. So I was like, okay, he was like, so you like, you know, like you would see that person can kill like, even if you get rid of guns, a crazy person can use a knife to kill people. And I was like, do you think 50 people that would have died in Orlando, or 49 people who died in Orlando, if this guy had a knife and he goes, well, probably not that many. And I was like, okay, that was fun and easy. But my point being that like, you know, we are in the middle of this, this gun pickle, which I think, you know, obvious, I think to people like you and I, we say, if you just make these guns harder to obtain, then that makes it all easier. But then there's other people who are like, no, the point is to make it so that everybody has them so you can defend yourself. But my point being that you trace it back to this time, the police weren't heavily armed, they weren't militarized because there wasn't a threat from regular people because they couldn't, they just hadn't gotten these assault rifles yet. They hadn't gotten these automatic weapons. And then there became a threat. And then there became that threat. So then the police have no choice but to overdo it because they don't ever want to be faced with a predicament like that. And then here you are where now everybody is just like, you have to arm yourself to the teeth to be the most armed for when this shit hits the fan. Whereas it would just be easier. It would be easier if the crazy people had revolvers and the rest of us didn't have anything. Instead, we're at the point where the sane people have revolvers and the crazy people have the you know, they have the nuclear option. Well, this you know, this is just an example of escalation. Yeah. And and what the responses, which is, yeah, it's all but the idea that there was a time where police would be in a gunfight. And they would be like, these guys have outgunned us. Yeah, that we've we have, I think, in order to protect police officers, they had to go the most extreme route, I guess, to never be able to be in that position again, which is why they have tanks. Well, okay, that's escalation. Yeah. Well, they do. Let's let's just all agree that cops should have tanks. Yeah, for sure. To protect and serve. And I have an indestructible machine. I think if you listen to the dollop, and you never heard about and you think about what you've heard on here in the history, I think that we're going to look back at this specific time. Yeah. As one of the darkest times in American history, and we will be ashamed of it. Oh, there's no question. I mean, we're in the middle of it. You know, it really is. It is it is it I mean, we're watching lobotomies on a stage crazy. You know what I mean? Like we are. We are so in deep with this craziness that you can't even call it crazy anymore. It's interesting. It's interesting to see where it goes. Oh, yeah, that's gonna be a fun ride. Can't wait to see where that goes. I'm serious. It is crazy. The same same people have to get guns because it's so out of hand with the crazies. I mean, that is all I mean, like that's that's the world we live in. People who wouldn't want guns, don't support guns, get guns because there's no way out of this gun situation. And then literally, when people point to Australia, like the reaction to what Australia did, like watching people find loopholes on. Well, yeah, but they have koala bears. You're like, what? I don't know what's happening. Yeah. I mean, you could so easily like, try. No, we can't try. There's no trying. There's no trying in baseball. Anyway, at least we sign cars.

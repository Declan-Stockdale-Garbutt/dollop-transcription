 Was that testing the mics or is the podcast started? All right, now I know the answer. It's Gareth and now I know that the podcast has started. So tired. Nice to sit down after driving out here from Will's house through the traffic. Look, I drove from Will's today too. So if you want to have a driving from Will's place contest, let's have it. Right. I already won it because I came over in traffic. All right. Well, that was a good game. Good game. Well played. Lots of ups and downs. My podcast was better. Excuse me? That I did with Will. You did a better podcast with Will than I did? I think so, yeah. How? You would have no way of knowing that. It just seems... No, you're just being a dick. You would have no way of knowing that. Excuse me? Generally the correct call. No. No. You don't know that. And if you did, good for you. I have a hard time dealing with your rage. My rage? You're making me rageful. You won't call me my... You're listening to The Dollop. This is a bi-weekly American history podcast. Each week I restore from the historical records of America to my friend. Gareth Reynolds who has no idea what the topic is going to be about. And he has anger issues. I do not have anger issues. God, do you want to look at a dude? I'll do one bottle. People say this is funny. No, I'm not. This is funny. Not Gary Gareth. They've okayed. Someone or something is tickling people. Is it for fun? And this is not going to become a tickling podcast. Okay. You are Queen Fakie of Made Up Town. All hail Queen Shit of Liesville. A bunch of religious virgins go to mingle. And do what? Pray. Hi Gary. No. I seek God, my friend. No. No. I seek God, my friend. 1832. There she is. Mary Fields was born a slave. Okay. In Hickman County. I mean not okay. Tennessee. Well, it seems like you've already. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. Gareth is pro slavery. Not much is known about her. I like how when it's slavery. I'm actually. I'm actually Gareth and not Gary. When it's I'm pro slavery, my name's right. Well, that's a very, very slave owner name. You know what? I have half a mind, boy. Gary is not a slave owning name, but Gareth is. Hi everyone. Not much is known about her early years. She spent the first three decades of her life as a slave. Okay. Until the Civil War. And then she was a free woman. Okay. She then moved to Mississippi. I don't know why you'd go south. Yeah. I mean, what's the thinking there early early reconstruction? There was a period where where or the former slaves had a nice had a kind of a nice ride and then the whites were like, hey, let's let's fuck this all up. Yeah. So there was a brief period where things were looking good. Still. I mean, then and then then. Which side would you rather be on? The one where they were like, fuck no to this. So the one where they were like, God damn it, we got to do this. I would run my ass north, but that's me. Yeah. So she moved to Mississippi and got a job working as a chambermaid on the steamboat Robert E. Lee. Interesting. I wouldn't. Yeah, I wouldn't get no I wouldn't get on that boat. She's making odd choices. Yeah. The Robert E. Lee had a famous race against another steamboat. The Bills and matches the Bills and matches. That's a terrible name. In 1870. Okay. Mary said the crew threw anything they could get their hands on into the boiler to make that ship move. Okay. That included sides of bacon and ham. They threw ham. I'm sorry. So they threw they for a while the Robert E. Lee was powered by ham. Yeah, they were throwing everything they could in the boiler and that included bacon and ham to get that ship moving because of the race. Yes. Okay. So I'm okay. I'm just boat. Yep. Just got a hand boat on her hands. She said quote, it was expected that the boilers would burst but they did not and the Robert E. Lee won. One of Mary's childhood friends became a nun. Okay. Her name was Mother Amadeus. Normal. She I don't want to give away but she ends up writing Rock Me Amadeus. She does? Yeah. That's awesome. Mother Amadeus was placed at the. Amadeus Amadeus Mother Amadeus. Yeah. All right. I thought it was going to go on. I think that's it. Yeah, it's pretty much it. There's the German rap where he's like, oh, yeah. Mother Amadeus was placed at the new St. Peter's convent near Cascade, Montana. So they're fucking set up a whole new shop of Montana. Right. Did you call it Montana? I did a little bit. Okay. I think that's a little Freudian. Look, I like to go to Montana every once in a while in the summer. Well, me and Dave summer in Montana. I'm sorry. Did you say Montana? I did not. Cascade was a small town that came to exist along the railroad between Helena and Great Falls. Okay. And Mother Amadeus came down with pneumonia in 1885. That's got to be a crazy thing for someone to say. Mother Amadeus has pneumonia. It's hard. It's a lot of words. Yeah. And she asked for Mary to come and join her and help her. And Mary came because they were old friends and she nursed Mother Amadeus back to health. What's pneumonia's deal? Isn't it contagious? Right? So I mean, I know it comes from usually you get the flu and then you get pneumonia. So maybe it's a virus that's a result of the flu. So it's a not can't say for sure. I haven't done a podcast. I mean, yeah. Okay. Mr. Mary took a job at the convent for nine bucks a week. Hot money then. That's not bad, right? No, I don't think that's bad. I don't think that's bad. She did everything. Plus you probably get three hots in a cot. Three what? Three hots in a cot. Three meals in a bed. She chopped wood, she dug holes and she helped build a schoolhouse and a chapel. Jesus. Okay. No fucking joke. All right. Did she have a blue ox? She eventually became the convent for woman. Okay. Yeah. Getting a little fucking respect. I respected her before. A fucking for woman. Yeah. And. Sounds like sister act so far. She would also drive the stagecoach. She's doing a lot of stuff. She's the fucking all over the place. She'd take visitors to and from the train station. She also made the 120 mile supply runs to Helena. Okay. She performed this duty alone, regardless of the weather. One night the horses were attacked by a pack of wolves and the wagon flipped. The horses scattered. Instead of bailing, Mary guarded the food shipment from wolves all night long. Whoa. The wolves would attack in a pack and Mary would blast them with her shotgun. Eventually she ran out of Buckshot and had to use her revolver. In the morning she was surrounded by the bodies of wolves. Well if she get if things got even hairier, I'm sure there was all ham on that wagon. Load a little ham in the gun. I don't know if the hams can be. Make some ham. That's okay. She managed to write the stagecoach on her own. That's fucking nuts. That's a heavy. That's heavy. That's a lot. I would just lay there and go, this is fucking. I would have gone. They'd be. I'd be like, oh, there were so many wolves. They'd be like, where's the food? I'd be like the food. He fucking rolled that shit over on her own and put it back on the road. And then she tracked down the horses. Hooked it back up. It fucking got going. Tracked them down. Hey, you went on and fucking got them in the woods or whatever. Is that happening to your voice? I'm sorry. I'm a little. That's what I do when I'm finding horses. It's got. Horse fighting boys. Oh, it's that a horse whispering. You're just a horse soprano. It's a horse fighting voice. Okay. That's adorable. You saved every single thing except a keg of molasses that broke. Let me ask you this. Did anyone see all this happen? No, but we believe her. Okay. The Bishop of Montana made her pay for the keg of molasses. Sorry. Yeah. The Bishop of Montana. Yeah. He fucking runs all the convents, right? The Montana's bishop made her pay for the molasses. Yeah. He was like, all right, where's the fucking molasses? That'll teach you. That's the thing that didn't make it. Well. Pony up. Come on now. Fair is fair. Pay for it. Did you eat the molasses? Fair is fair. Curge out. She was dipping her fist in the molasses the whole way. It's where they called her molasses Mary. Well, that makes sense. The big problem with Mary at the convent was that she was a bit rough around the edges. It sounds like it. She dressed in men's clothes. Okay. Although she did wear an apron when working, but under the apron she always kept a revolver. Just in case, you know, nuns. Sure. You know? They are violently unpredictable. And in the apron pocket, she kept a flask of whiskey. I mean, the sofa, she sounds pretty cool. Right? I'd say very cool. Under the apron, oh, I already did that. Mary was said to have been a very good shot with both the revolver and her rifle. She was around 200 pounds, very tall. She loved drinking, smoking home rolled cigars, swearing and arguing politics. And playing with her dick. Okay. So she really, I mean, she's a Tom man. Yeah, she's a Tom man. The nuns tried to get married to be more ladylike, but she enjoyed hanging with the men in town more than at the convent. That's got to be fucking great though. Like as like, I mean, at this point she has to feel pretty comfortable being out and being black. And so she can now, now you're almost the maybe like a novelty to some of these places where they're like this fucking chick who drinks whiskey and is a great shot is going to come in. She flips wagons. Right? She, back then there wasn't, it wasn't, there were a lot of cowboys, black cowboys. It's very common. You don't see, they don't put that in the movies, but there were a ton of black cowboys. No, I've seen black cowboys on some. Because they used to fucking bail and they would run away and that's where they would go. They'd be like, all right, I'm going to go be a fucking cowboy. Yeah. Like you said, would you go to Mississippi? Or you'd be like, Hey, how about out West? And I got on some horses. I'd go to Montana. Montana. So the town, the women of the town of Cascade, I'm guessing they took to her. Well, they liked her. Well, they didn't think she was ladylike. And then they pushed for a lot of be passed that barred all women from drinking in Cascade. Okay. But you can't, I mean, just because they didn't like, I just think the religious folk, yeah, they didn't like a lady doing that shit. Okay. Yeah. And you're making the right face. Yeah. It's not a cool move. It's smelly. I've making smell face. But then the mayor of Cascade ordered that Mary be the only woman who was allowed to drink a little bar. Now what happened was this was sounding pretty dumb and now it's really awesome. Backfire. Now it's really awesome because that is so bad ass. If you were the only person of your gender to be able to drink fucking amazing. Holy shit. She also enjoyed a good fist fight. Okay. All right. Now notice I didn't say she got into them. I said she enjoyed. Right. Enjoyed. Pursued. Mary was known to be able to beat up any two men at once in Montana. Get out of here. That's what it said. Any two men at once. So you can pick any two men in Montana and she would take them on at the same time. Wow. She had a standing bet. She could knock out any man with one punch. Well she's a monster. The bet was a dime and she never lost once. She could knock someone out with one fucking punch. She dropped your shit. Well she's a fucking linebacker. She's 200 pounds. When I heard the wagon flip and the weight the first thing I thought was what an inside linebacker. Great insight. She would have been a great inside linebacker. A saloon in town had a standing bet that any man who could take a punch from Mary and remain on his feet would get five dollars and a free shot of whiskey. Wow. Do you know how many guys tried it because of the free shot of whiskey? Oh she must have. Oh she's hot. Go ahead hit me. You big mother. Try. Where are you? I got a strong chin. Come on you big dumb idiot. At a local ranch Mary got into an argument with the ranch foreman over a harness. You could see how that would happen. Sure. What does that mean exactly? You're going to fight over like a horse? The way you harness a horse. She's like no that's not right. And he's like what are you talking about? You're a fucking woman. I don't know if she was like no that's not right. She was like hey. Hey fucker. Hey ass face. Hey you piece of shit. Hey I'll knock you out. You put this on this way you fucking animal. Hey what are you doing lady? That's it. Shut your goddamn manhole. Alright Mary relax. Fuck you I'll relax on your face. God damn it Mary do whatever you want to the horse just leave me alone. My fists are clenching again. Fuck Mary. My lady fists. Too dead. She picked up a rock and smashed the foreman in the head. Whoa Mary. Why you bugging? That's one way to end an argument. One nun said may God help anyone who walks on the lawn after Mary has cut it. Wow. She's just a fucking like she should be in Game of Thrones. By the way she cut it but with being on her hands and knees and using her teeth right? Yeah she ate it with her mouth. The Great Falls Examiner newspaper said she had quote broken more noses than any other person in Montana. First of all it's a hard thing to corroborate. I mean that's a hard thing to say that that is definitely. No they kept records. Really? Back then that's the only thing they kept actually diligent records of. Just nose breaks. Yeah. And by whom? There's no dental records. Nothing else but just nose breaks. The Native Americans called Mary white crow. Interesting. Little bit of reverse of the. Yeah a white crow. Because they said she acts like a white woman but has black skin. Okay. I don't think she sounds to me like she doesn't act like any woman. Yeah no yeah that's true right. She acts like a dude. It just said yeah. It should have been dude crow. We call her dude crow. Lady dude crow. We call her dude crow. She genderbender. We think we call her must talk. She must talk. Only explanation. Talk or junk. Must talk lady. She's must talk. One school girl wrote an essay saying quote she drinks whiskey and she swears and she is a Republican which makes her a low foul creature. Yeah. This is a time when this was a Republican. Republicans freed the slaves. She has liberal written all over her in today's day and age. Well they were more liberal the Republicans back then than the Democrats. Well that's the same. Mary was a hard worker. She washed all the clothes and linens and took care of the convent's 400 chickens as well as tending the garden. That's a lot of chickens. Yeah. Can we just think about that? That's like a Tyson coop. A what? Tyson chicken coop. Oh not like Mike Tyson. No both maybe. Oh my God look all these beautiful chickens inside of here. They used to be pigeons but now they're like baby chicks. I like the rub them on my face. Yeah look at this chicken. I want to punch you. I used to chase them and now all I want to do is hug them. I like to smash them against the rocks. I'm violent. I guess what you could say is that I'm pretty violent. She was pretty much indispensable. She also fought a skunk that got into the chicken coop. Fought? How did she fight it? I'll knock him out. She put on her fist and started punching that shit. That skunk didn't know what he was up against. So she's like a, I mean she's a celebrity arguably right? Yeah she's a celebrity for sure. I mean in this area. When Mary discovered it the skunk had already killed 60 baby chicks. So I think it was like on a fucking tear. Like I'm skunking. Snappity snap snap snap. He's having a good time. She killed it and dragged the dead skunk a mile back to the convent where she showed it to the nuns and a visiting chaplain. Look what I've done. That kind of seems. Hey ladies gather round. Look at this shit. That's like cat behind. What did that Mary motherfucking cunt fuck fields. But that's like cat behavior. Where like a cat will be like here's the bird. You're like no I don't. They're like for you. I got you the bird. Dude I don't need to see it. I got you a bird. Dude I'm good. This is our bird. I'm good. Without the bird. I'll skin it and then we'll eat it raw together. It is our bird. You're welcome. The nuns asked her how she avoided getting sprayed and she said she just attacked it from the front. You know the thing about skunks is they're able to rotate pretty quick. Wouldn't that be a great scene in Rocky. Yeah. Come back the next day. Show him soaking in the tub and then he comes back. Then when he's finally fighting the other fighter is like Rock you stink. Jesus Rocky why don't you take a shower. I haven't tasted skunk forever. Take a shower in there Rocky. I did show. There's a skunk. What? There was a skunk. What? There was a what? Hey I already showered. One of the train tanks. I changed skunk. That's my wife. Jesus you're an idiot huh Rock. Okay. Mary worked at the convent for 10 years but her reputation was her undoing. The Bishop of Montana had been hearing many complaints about her behavior and then she went a bit too far. Well she was the only woman allowed to drink. Right. I mean that will make you feel a little empowered. It's very empowered. Yeah. She's like a superhero. She's like being a slave to being the only woman in the town who could drink. And beat everybody up. And beat the fuck out of everybody. Yeah. That's quite a 180. The convent handyman was apparently upset that Mary made more money than he did. Okay. Well he's going to get knocked the fuck out. So he started complaining to anyone who had ears. Okay. All over the town he complained about Mary. Finally Mary heard about his loud mouth. Oh God. And challenged him to a duel. Mary. On convent property. Mary. Oh on convent property? Why there? Because it's where she heard about it. She heard about it. She just went to where he was. She heard about it and she just fucking went straight to the dude and was like let's do this shit. You want to fuck with a bro? That is baller. You're not a bro. I am too. I'm a bro. So the foreman agreed or the handyman agreed and somehow in the duel Mary shot him in the ass. Wow. Now one of two things happened. He was still walking his ten paces and she shot him in the ass. Likely, right? Or he fell and turned. She shot him in the butt. Yeah. Who as a defense is like my heiny. Yeah she shot him in the ass. Yeah he was like nah. Fucking bitch. Bottom. Bottom shooter. Fucking bitch. So that was it for the bishop. He had it. He ordered Mary to leave the convent. I love how there was a time when like it was like how you dueled in the streets was unfair. Alright enough. I have now had it up to here with you. Here's a rule to the anarchy. Everything else was fine. But I was shooting my man in the buttocks. Listen if you don't have respectful duel game what's left? So she had to leave the convent. Okay. Father Amadeus got Mary a job as a mail carrier between the convent and Cascade. So she was a dude. Oh I get it. Took me a while. I was like did I read something wrong? Nope. It's just a different word. So she got her job as a mail lady. Right. Mailman lady. She bought Mary a wagon and a team of horses. Mary was now the second woman in the US to have a mail route but she didn't just get the job because she asked for it. Getting a job at the puzzle service was very hard. Applicants would compete against each other. So there'd be a fucking job up and everyone would come down and they'd be like alright let's see who's got the fucking goods. Really? And they would each hitch a team of six horses to a stage coach and whoever did it the fastest got the job. That is such a funny, like first of all we should do more shit like that. There should be more, you should make. Time trials. Totally. Yes. But also that really, if you're going to do that you should really set up a little more of a course. I mean there's way more to being a mail carrier than just hitching a wagon. I agree but after you hitch the wagon you're so tired. You hitch all the horses. So she did it fastest. At the age of 60. Holy shit. You need all the dudes who are probably, let's be honest, in their 20s. Some fucking crazy old lady who's nine feet tall and weighs 400 pounds just comes over and they're like is she mythical? She's hammered out of her mind. She's just left a trail of dudes knocked out. She hitches a bunch of horses. Smells like skunk. So she's the second mailwoman. First black mail carrier, male or female, she's the very first black. Wow. To hold a position. She never failed once to deliver a letter. That's pretty crazy. She was never said to be late. If the snow got too high she would tie up the horses to a tree and carry the mail on her back. What? She would leave? If the horses couldn't walk in the snow anymore. But how, she must have been, how far would she be going? I don't know. I mean it sounds like. Miles. Yeah, it sounds like there was like a hundred or so miles. So she'd tie up the horses and be like I'll be back. Oh my God. And then she'd just fucking cruise off with her fucking bag of shit. It was during this period that Mary got her nickname stage coach. Yeah. Stage coach Mary. Stage coach Mary. Because they're like she is a stage coach. She doesn't need one. She is one. Yeah. In 1903 Mother Amadeus was sent to Alaska to set up a mission. Mary was now 70. She was devastated to lose her friend. All right. Let's talk about this. Okay. So there's a nut. There's a woman who wants to be a nut. And there is another lady and they grew up together and she's a tough son of a bitch. And the first time he goes and she goes hey come see me here. Come visit me. Come hang with me. Come live with me. Yeah. She gets her job. Wait a minute. And then she gets fired and she's like hey I'll buy you some stuff. I'll buy you like a new car. You're right. They were good friends. And then you can still live around here and I'll see you around. Good pals like to keep in touch. By the way I like it when you're tough and rough. Tough and rough and tough. I like to see that sort of you know a woman embrace her womanhood and you know really be tough. You know. And then the nun gets fired or moved to another place in Alaska and you can't follow and you're like I'm home. I'm broke. Wants to see her friend. Because my lover is gone. What? Lover? David. Mary stopped the mail route and moved to the town of Cascade. Okay. So they were definitely fucking. Yeah. She was such a local hero that the town would close the school in honor of her birthday. I mean. Even though she didn't know what day her birthday was. What? She didn't know what day her birthday was. So they were like. She was a slave. How would she fucking know? You know what I mean? I mean who knows what kind of records they kept. So she just what did she just do? Invent it or one day a year she'd be like I feel like tomorrow. I think that no she wouldn't change it yearly but she they said that it's there are a couple places that she got to pick her birthday. She would say twice a year she had a birthday. So I mean if you if you are a lot of that luxury you should take a little bit of advantage of it. Yeah if you're if you're gonna get you know huge rewards for having a birthday you might as well bring that in a couple times a year. It was like her dead grandma like the dead grandma excuse when you were in school. That's exactly it. In college. How many dead grandmas? I had a lot. Oh yeah. Marry me to living. I ran out eventually and had to make up new stuff. I mean that's how many dead grandmas I had. Jesus. It's a massacre. Yeah. No it was a. It was a massacre. I had a side of grandma's what I had. It's been acknowledged as such. Mary made a living by doing laundry for locals in her home and she kept on drinking fighting and swearing. One day she was drinking in a saloon when a man who owed her two dollars for doing laundry walked by. Well I'm going to go ahead and take a guess that this guy gets a little guff. She stormed after him and she grabbed him by the collar spun him around and punched him in the face. She's over 70. Yes. She's. Yes. Then she walked back to the bar and sat down and said his laundry bill is paid. Oh my God. Was that maybe the first catchphrase? That maybe the first like tag. Well she's the first squirts nigger. The first tag for sure. Yeah. His laundry is paid. Wow. Yeah. It's amazing. Mary also opened a restaurant which did not do well because she gave everyone credit who couldn't afford to pay. Yeah. She went broke twice trying to run the restaurant before shutting it down. Okay. She was loved in the town. When the local hotel was sold part of the contract said that the new owner had to give Mary free meals for the rest of her life. Wow. When her house burned down the locals got together and built her a new one. Mary also babysat a lot of the kids in town. One of them was a boy visiting for a while from the city of Dearborn. His name was Gary Cooper. Gary Cooper loved her so much as a kid that right before he died he read an article for her in Ebony magazine. Okay. It's the Gary Cooper. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's fucking crazy. Yeah. But he was so affected by her by just being with her a little time as like a fucking nine year old. That he wrote about her. That he still with all the shit that he did in Hollywood and all the fucking ladies he tore through because he's Gary Cooper so he fucked his way through this town. Okay. And did all the blow he did. Right. It's Gary Cooper. Right? Yeah. Just blow off of Hooker's breast. The whole Cooper legend. Sure. That was what he was doing. Which I'm now completely fabricating. Right. He did all that and at the end he was like man how about that giant seven year old black lady. I'm his stage coach. Oh stage coach. Mary also adopted the Cascade baseball team. She adopted them? She was like I'm the team mother. I take care of my boys. That kind of thing. Okay. She gave them flowers at each game and anyone who hit home runs she gave flowers to. Yeah. Anyone who didn't she beat the fuck out of. If anyone would talk shit about the team she'd punch them in the face. But at this age. She's so old. Honestly like this is a while ago. I mean my guess is life expectancy wasn't even 70. No. This is crazy. So she's not only far surpassing. Especially for a black woman. Life expectancy. She was a slave. She's not only surpassing life expectancy but she in this day and age what she's doing would be considered insane. Oh no. Fucking crazy. Beating the shit out of people. No she'd be a celebrity. Oh God. How quickly she'd be on Dancing with the Stars. Oh Trump would be like you gotta run with me. Yeah. You gotta be my running mate. In 1914 Mary got the feeling she was close to death. She did not want to be a burden on her friends. So in the middle of the night she got up and walked out of her house. Oh God. And laid down in some tall weeds. She did the dog move. She did what dogs do. Who does that? She just went outside to lay down and die. And die? But some young kids were playing there the next day and they found her. Still alive? Yeah. I need a couple more days to die please. My clock was off. Come on. I'm in the weeds. What? The locals took her to Columbus Hospital in Great Falls. Don't you come to a hospital. Leave me in the weeds. No I'd rather just die in the weeds over the weeds. You're going to the hospital. Fuck yeah you son of a bitch. Come down here close. Mary. Stage coach Mary died a few days later at the age of 82 of liver failure. Wow. Because she's fucking pounding. Wow. She was a giant alcoholic. Giant lesbian alcoholic. Oh man. She was buried in a small cemetery between Cascade and St. Peter's Mission. It's fucking nuts. And you can still hear the ghost of Mary beating the shit out of other ghosts. You can. She's kicking the fucking shit out of other ghosts. You can still hear mother fucker. Mother son of a bitch. His laundry bill is paid. Mary. Your laundry bill is paid. A laundry bill. Alright. Good job. That's what happens when you mix whites with colors.

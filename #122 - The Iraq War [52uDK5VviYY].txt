 I Never knew how it finished you're gonna about to find out what happens she gets a duck what the fuck yeah Not Gary Gara, okay someone or something is tickling And this is not gonna come the tickling plot. Okay, you are Queen fakie of made-up town All hail Queen shit of Liesville a bunch of religious virgins go to mingle and do what? Shit This is it. This is what people been waiting for I wish I could have spent more time on this But I wanted to do it before Marin started the Iraq war I Here we go needless to say I don't need butter. I don't need to shout out the date that that all kicked off on No, you can shout at the president who kicked it off President George W Bush told his crew to start planning for an invasion of Iraq just months after 9-eleven. I already am so pissed The man who began planning at the Pentagon was named Douglas Fife He was the undersecretary of defense for policy and ran a super double secret office called the office of special plan the office of special plan yeah, it was a It's kind of a stupid day. It's really a stupid. It's a terrible day the office of spec because it's just singular It is saying there should be office of special planning. I mean at least something some action office of the Iraq plan This room this this sounds like a like a I'm the vice president of shh But this also it's like happy chicken, it's like it right you like happy chicken like yeah, it's right. Yeah But it should be a special plan should be on an Asian menu. Yes. Yes Fife was a big fan of a man named Ahmad Shalabi Ahmad Shalabi was an Iraqi exile who ran a political organization called the Iraqi National Congress Shalabi was a mathematician who had attended MIT and was hated at the State Department and the CIA Interesting both considered Shalabi to be corrupt and very unpopular with Iraqis but Neocons like Fife Love Shalabi he was the shit because he told them everything they wanted to hear like that Iraq could be a secular democracy That it would embrace the West and recognize the Iraq as a country That it would embrace the West and recognize Israel we'd be greeted as liberators naturally This was the Cheney Rumsfeld Rumsfeld Fife dream leader of Iraq once Saddam was gone Fife's office was very secret double secret. Jesus Christ super double special secret. Yeah He did not coordinate with the State Department or the CIA. I Mean just even that right like how is that even possible? He really didn't like focusing on worst-case scenarios and that's one of the things the State Department and CIA did Yeah, that really is right. That's basically what they do. That's their job. Yeah Total negative Nancy's those groups. Yeah, really if you talked about the negatives then people might not want to have Invade Iraq and we couldn't have that could we no no no Fife's office looked at the war as one of To be one of liberation and he believed it would be really easy. Yeah, super easy The Iraqis wouldn't need much assistance after Saddam was gone. It would quickly take over Running the country. God. I just I remember just hearing it all All of like hearing all of this being yet said and if you're just thinking like that doesn't that just doesn't seem right But then it turned out to be but then yeah, I did. Yeah history has judged it fondly Two months before the invasion a fight called Jay Garner a retired lieutenant general He asked Garner to run Iraq after the invasion and get things transitioned into Iraqi hands. Sure Fife told Garner it would take around 90 days That's just It's like we're remodeling a kitchen. You can't do anything in 90 days I mean honestly like you could redo your bathroom You couldn't even then no you could show would come up and the contractor would have to do fucking you get the wrong pie You could get you could go from 90 days to a nice bathroom in 90 days. Yes Yes, yeah. Yeah, I bet you my brother could do it in 60 Garner accepted the position and his group was called the office of reconstruction and humanitarian assistance or Or ha Garner said about trying to get things ready, but Fife did not give him any plans or reports He did not get any of any of these State Department plans or the analysis From the CIA he didn't even get the unclassified report written by the military's own National Defense University based on a two-day workshop Involving more than 70 scholars and experts. He got nothing When Garner asked Fife for some documents Fife told them that nothing useful existed. No, there's nothing We should go in The guy who needs to fucking do everything you're like, no, you don't need any paperwork What do you need stuff for? Oh, you're a real bookworm huh? I'm a reader, I like the read stuff. Just get in there get your hands dirty Get in there just say yes, there's a yes stamp in there. Just use your yes stamp Fife figured that with no reports Garner would just end up talking to Chalabi Which is what happened Fife also never planned to have American experts ready to run Iraqi ministries after the war He figured Iraqi civil servants would just jump in and run everything I just can't I mean it it is just the clusterfuck of all clusterfuck Oh dude, and you have no idea where this is going. It's even you're going to have your fucking jaw on the floor when I'm done Oh man So Garner really didn't need that much or any information according to Fife, but Garner got to work Putting a team together and making plans two days before leaving for Iraq Garner was called to Secretary of Defense Rumfeld's office And Rumfeld questioned Garner why he had hired the people he had hired Especially the people from the State Department Quote, I'm just uncomfortable with these people said Rumfeld Ah And Garner asked well who from the Department of Defense do you have that's qualified to do agriculture And Rumfeld just stared at him How about education? Rumfeld did not have an answer Garner went down the list of people he needed Banking? Rumfeld finally said look I'm not going to argue with you on this one, but I'm gonna get you other people What? That is arguing That is not That's totally arguing with him Rumfeld then blocked all senior State Department people Garner had hired What the fuck He said they were too bureaucratic What? They must have been like well hello Pot The Pentagon wanted as few State Department people on the team as possible because anyone from the State Department understood worst case scenario and would immediately raise red flags about the planning Jesus Christ On March 19, 2003 the invasion of Iraq began What a time And went pretty fucking smooth Yeah, shockin' off Aside from all the dead people in the destruction zone Yeah, well no, but when you're doing shockin' off you're gonna have some dead people Girl You know what I mean? That's the shock part And the awe Yeah, and the awe As in you're like oh wow, oh why did we do that It wasn't much of a fight, the elite forces put up resistance, but when the fighting started the regular army just put on their civilian clothes and went home They had been told not to fight by dropped leaflets The vast majority were not loyal to Saddam anyway, but loyal to their country and they said they would just wait around for new orders after the US took over On April 9, an army tank toppled a huge statue of Saddam That was the big moment of the war, it was now over in the Iraqis eyes Yeah, well the statue came down This is, we're peeking right now, right? Yeah, this is good times This is as good as it got This is as good as it got This is when you were watching it and you were like well shit, this actually did go pretty well Yeah, it went okay And then the looting started They began at the Ministry of Industry's headquarters There were no US troops guarding the ministries, so the looters went after the building like the Rube went after a fire truck Oh God They tore it apart Before the war, Baghdad was a hopping place, shops stayed open until 10, restaurants till midnight, nobody worried about driving home late at night It was an incredibly safe city because Saddam would lock your shit up or cut off your hands for the smallest crime It was like Vegas in the 60s Now the opposite was happening, total chaos and no one in charge When the looting began, the ORHA ministers watched on television and assumed the military was on their way to protect the buildings But it wasn't No troops had been assigned to guard the ministries And there was still no consideration to put troops there even after the looting started How is that possible? The only ministry being protected by American troops was the Ministry of Oil Ugh It's so obviously transparent, like it's so fantastically How is it so transparent? It's so fantastic Like at least, you know, we used to get, like this was the first time somebody just straight up looked you in the eyes and fucked you as a citizen You know, you're used to getting fucked minorly but you'd normally just wake up and your butt would hurt Now you're literally forced to have the eye contact while I'm fucking you I'm fucking you right now And just shouting it I'm fucking you, I'm fucking you When asked about why the looting wasn't stopped, Rumsfeld said, freedom's untidy Freedom? Freedom is, he's, I mean he's obviously Satan's penis, but he is great with that stuff You could put that in as a phrase that a Marvel villain would say And he's got tons, have you ever seen the fog of war? Oh yeah He's got tons of them He's got so many where you're just like I'm glad this happened The streets became a free for all by the time it was over A freedom for all The OHA believed the looting had caused more damage to Iraq's infrastructure than the entire bombing campaign OHA contractors got their ministries and quickly realized how fucked they were One man running the Ministry of Health named Carney only had two people as his staff There were over 100,000 employees at the Ministry and he didn't have a budget Wait, he had 100,000 people on his staff? He was brought in to take over the Ministry of Health There were 100,000 employees and it's just him Oh my god Garner said about putting together a plan for how much power to give the Iraqis And when he would hand them back the power of their country Meanwhile, the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House had not agreed to anything Cheney and Rumsel wanted Chalabi to take over, obviously And Bush and Rice didn't know what they wanted, which is great When Garner arrived in Iraq, he thought elections should be held within 90 days as he was told And he told the press that Then Rumsel and Fythe flipped out and were pissed off at him Because they thought an election wouldn't leave Chalabi in charge And the White House was also upset so they fired Garner Good, get him out They decided to hire what is called a take charge kind of fella Wait, no, okay This is the guy no one knows about or people don't talk about Bush, Cheney, Rumsel and Rice had a meeting and tossed out different names Rudy Giuliani, but he had just opened up a consulting firm They went over former governors and ex-senators, but they couldn't agree And then Cheney suggested Paul Bremer And that was that He was a company man, Republican with lots of experience, he worked for Kissinger You know, all the good shit Good track record He was a rich kid who went to Yale and then got a degree in business from Harvard And then went to get another degree in Paris He joined the Foreign Service I just got a degree in Paris for whatever He worked at the State Department, was stationed in Norway and in Kabul, Afghanistan But he spent a lot of time in the US at the State Department He was moving up the ranks Reagan then appointed him ambassador to the Netherlands A really valuable position Guess what he didn't speak? Dutch Yep He then quit the government and worked for Kissinger's consulting firm He received a shitload of awards for his work in the government and was successful in the business world At the time of the 9-11 attacks, he worked for a business with 1700 other employees in the North Tower of the World Trade Center Above where the second plane hit So, ORHA was done Bremer would be the new head of an organization called the Coalition Provisional Authority, the CPA Coalition Provisional Authority, okay Garner hadn't even been in charge in Iraq for a month And now he was no longer in charge He had no reports, no information, no money, and all the buildings he needed to run The country had been ripped apart, so he was considered a failure That's so true, right? You really fucked this one up No, I don't think Guys Please Yeah, no, you really did a shitty job Well, in my defense, what's happening everywhere? Okay, well, you should have fixed that No, the, um Bremer hit the ground running He'd meet at eight with his staff every day People were told to make their points in 30 seconds or less And he'd make a decision just as quickly Uh, that's more like a game show That is how you rebuild a country 30 seconds or less Welcome back to 30 seconds or less Today we're going to try to rebuild Iraq through ideas that are pitched in under 30 seconds And then Paul Bremer has 30 seconds to decide if he wants to enact that or not 30 seconds or less, your time starts now Well, I want to rebuild the bridge We need to get a consulting firm to come in and rebuild the bridge And what we need is security around the bridge And we're also going to need 10 seconds We're going to need a new kind of bridge Fuck! Um, no God damn it It's a really important bridge Sorry 30 seconds is up, I'm sorry sir 30 seconds or less is brought to you by Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein, he used to be the glue that nobody respected In May 2003, Bremer sent Rumsfeld a report made by RAND The US Military Think Tank and Military Contractor It said that 500,000 troops were needed to stabilize Iraq That was three times more than were currently in Iraq And Rumsfeld just ignored it That is the problem, right? It's just like, it's not, the problem wasn't the not knowing of the facts Oh no The problem was not wanting to deal with the facts No, it's not even that, it's worse than not knowing It's willful ignorance It's willfully trying to put what you believe the world to be On something that is not going to be that Totally It's like staring at water and going, your wood! Oh man Now Bremer had a plan, it was a three part plan First, he wanted to restore electricity, water and other basic services Jesus, yes Makes sense Yes Next, he wanted to quote, put liquidity in the hand of the people So, he's talking about reopening banks, offering loans, paying salaries, etc. The third part of his awesome plan was to quote, Corporatize and privatize state owned enterprises You're me, now which one of those? Okay He wanted to get people away from the idea that the state should support everything It was time for Iraq to experience the awesomeness of a free market economy In a country where huge amounts of people have been living off the government for their entire lives No part of his three part plan did it say, make things secure Right So, another thing Bremer did was to end the horrible bureaucracy that he had to deal with Okay Sending ideas and reports to the State Department and the Pentagon and the CIA and the NSC, blah blah blah blah blah Yeah, well it's supposed to be easy to rebuild a nation He said quote, he didn't want to deal with the Washington squirrel cage Sorry, pal, tough shit He didn't want to wait around for approval, he wanted to get shit done, so the White House said, go for it dog! Oh my god You are the man! Now he only needed to go to the White House for really big things and everything else he could make a decision on his own This is how you rebuild a country How is it, if you're George W. Bush He's fucking lazy But how, how is, how, is it, is it, because it always baffles me Because I'm like, he's for sure dumb and he's like not good with English But he's also not, like people made it sound like he's like handicapped, like he's definitely No, I don't think he's handicapped Capable of understanding reality No, I think he doesn't give a shit So he's just that, like he's, he's, it's just, it's so hard to, cause I, look, I, like I told you, I used to go run up these stairs in Hollywood And what I used to picture on the ones that would get hard is I'd picture George W. Bush at the top of the stairs so I could beat the fuck out of it To motivate me to like keep going up the stairs But so I, I despise the man, but I also, I'm always like baffled by what is in that fucking head He doesn't give a shit And it's just ambivalence He's a fucking party boy, he doesn't care He's never cared about anything It's probably, I mean yeah, it's just, it's shocking, it's still shocking, anyway So, stole both elections Eleven days after he got to Iraq, Bremer dissolved Cause now he can make as ever decision he wants He dissolved the Army, Air Force, Navy, Ministry of Defense, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service No biggie, it's no big deal Just all of the Aren't those The military? Isn't that, yeah, yeah, the military Yeah The military's a good one to start with No biggie, right? Meanwhile, Powell thought Bremer was fucking nuts And so he got the few lower level State Department personnel who were working for the CPA to write memos to the State Department using their personal email like Hotmail or Yahoo So it couldn't be detected Wow As far as staff, Bremer chose three Republican advisors who had been around a long time and had experience The rest of the post were filled with young Republican yes people They were fawning parasites who never challenged anything Bremer said For the vast majority, this was their first job working in government And they all believed very strongly in building a democratic Iraq But But what? Experience was needed There was one man who had been working on Iraq for quite some time, Afghan born, now American, Al-Khlazili He was a White House envoy who had been spending months trying to smooth the coming political transition and put together an interim government He said he had been speaking to exiled leaders and was very trusted He was the man you'd want by your side if you were Bremer So naturally, Bremer viewed him as a threat Right, good Here was a guy who knew more than him about the situation Bremer was supposed to be running That meant he might have other ideas that Bremer might not agree with and Bremer was in charge Did I mention he was in charge? Yeah So that guy wasn't hired Right So Bremer came to Iraq after telling someone in Washington that he was going to quote make some bold decisions It's not a f- you're not- you're not renovating Yeah, he's making- You're not renovating You know what Iraq needs? No Just some fucking straight up hard decision making Oh my god That's what it needs, hard decision- you let people do it Guys got to come in and go, yes, no, yes, no How is there not a show yet where people go and do makeovers at homes in Iraq? Like Iraqi home makeover? How is that not- like we've completely ruined the country And normally what we do to at least our coping mechanism is to feel like we're helping a few How is that not- That's so great How is that not a show yet? That's so great Alright Kaleeps, today what we're going to do is we're going to change your entire home Well, I- I- I'd have been changed, it's just a rubble- it's just a pile Okay, talk to me, don't look at the camera It's a pile Okay, I told you his- Bricks, my brother Okay, um, well, first of all, you're going to get a whole new kitchen Well, my brother Do you like marine tiles? I don't know We'll go with small tiles, it'll take a while And these cabinets here, these are so old I mean, we're going to rip down those and we're going to give you some cutting edge designs Yeah, they're down, they're on the ground, they're- Exactly, and cabinets should be hung up, so we're going to bring in some people to do that And we have some great ideas for the living room Flat screen anyone? My brother is sleep bomb Mm-hmm, mm-hmm You know, maybe we don't need you on camera for this one, just maybe we just redo the house He's really negative, I guess his brother- his brother was killed out here And he's just crying a lot Next up on Iraqi Bank Over So Bremer, uh, so right, so he says he's going to make some bold decisions He did, when he got to Iraq in his first meeting, he said they should shoot looters He was somehow talked out of this great idea I think I'm just going to say that the catchphrase I'll have is how Then someone mentioned de-bathification, which was the- A shower Which was purging senior members of Saddam's bath party from the government Bremer was so for it, the CIA and State Department were super not for it They wanted what was called de-Saddamification, getting rid of those who were very top commanders And those who had committed crimes So Bush met with the CIA, the State, and Pentagon, and everyone argued And in the end, the NSC came up with a compromise The top 1% of bathists would be purged, and then the rest of the party would have to go through a truth and reconciliation process Basically vetting them, okay? Okay Bush was down with it, so that was that Sorry, so the plan is to take the top 1% of bathists Right, the really bad guys Right, and use them No, get rid of them, they're just gone And then the rest of them, you vet them and make sure that they weren't Right, the rest of them you put through some sort of Scientology class where they hold the rod That's right The cool thing was that the NSC had no idea how the bath party was structured Or how many people were on each level, or what each level meant, or anything They could have looked up this information on the internet Or read papers about the party All of this information was easily available to anyone, particularly those people who had just invaded and needed that information But nobody read it But how? Like how do you... How? It just takes time How do you not... And my daughter has a recital How do you not just by discussion of this plan... Can I tell you something? When this was going on, I looked it up and read about it And you had a good feeling So they went blind into the decision So here's how the bath party was structured There were four top levels of the bath party Below that were just regular members and cadets The top four levels were the concern, right? Uh-huh But Bush had made his decision, and they were basically going to be vetted Okay? Nope, Fife got together with Chalabi, and they came up with their own de-bathification plan So somebody's out bad planning dub you? Well, the president has made his decision, but then this other guy, the Department of Defense decided to... Me and Chalabi actually spitballed a little, and uh... Nah, we don't need to do all that stuff, Chalabi's got us In there's all four levels of the bath party, and group members known as the Udu-Furqa would be purged Bremer met with Fife, and because this was one of those great 30-second ideas, he jumped on it Bremer had said he wanted to make bold decisions, and this was a fucking bold decision And really fucking stupid And fast And it was not at all what the president signed off on, so... Here's the thing you're learning right now It wasn't that Bush was stupid, it was that he was stupid, and then dumber people did dumber things But it's... see, that's what's so hard, it's not just dumb, it's just... It's just wrong, like it's just like wrong, like you're saying, they're blissfully ignorant They're blissfully ignorant, that's right, they're going in with everything they do They look at the rosiest picture, and they don't actually look at the evidence or the analysis or anything They just make a decision based on what they want it to be And then the idea that that can carry... like when it was going on, you were like... Honestly, I remember saying to a friend of mine, like, they just, they must know what they're doing Just because it seemed so ludicrous, that you're almost like, they must have it It's not even as ludicrous, you don't even know how ludicrous it is yet But the idea that I was right, some shit head on a couch smoking weed You're not right, it's so much worse than you ever imagined So Fythe just printed up one and a half page executive order of his plan And including banning members of, regular members of the Bath Party from having top level jobs in government He showed it to Rumseld, but not Powell or Rice or Bush, and Rumseld was like, fucking cool man, send that shit out When Garner read the report, he almost shit himself He thought it was the dumbest and craziest thing he'd ever read He ran into Bremer's office and said, this is too harsh, let's get Rumseld on the phone And see if we can soften it And Bremer looked at him and said, absolutely not, we're going to issue this today Garner pleaded, you're going to drive 50,000 bathys underground before nightfall, don't do this The CIA station chief in Baghdad said, in six months you'll regret this Bremer didn't give a shit Depathification of Iraqi society, or as it can now be called The creation of the insurgency and the biggest post-World War II fuck up in American history Was read by Bremer to his CPA staff that night One guy, some total fucking asshole loudmouth, right, sort of fella, his name is Steve Browning He opens his fucking Yappel and he said, the bathys are the brains of the government The ones with a lot of information and knowledge and understanding of how everything works If they're purged, the CPA will have a huge problem running anything But what did Browning know? He was only in charge of running five ministries at that time Bremer said, the order is not open for discussion Look, the 30 seconds are up, bro Sorry, bro, you're not going to the lightning round Another staffer asked Bremer if he completely understood the impact his policy would have As she continued on, she grew angrier and her face red as she spoke Bremer finally cut her off and said the decision was made and left Fuck That night, David Nummy, who was currently working Nummy? Nummy Mr. Nummy? Who was currently working at the finance ministry, called Bremer's office and told the staffer Quote, if you want me to enforce this, I'm leaving on the next plane out of the country Because it's ill-advised and you have no idea how far back it's going to set us If those people disappear and we don't have the tools to find the next generation Bremer did it anyway Nummy was gone within a month The purge was on The order went public That was 700,000 government workers who were used to being in power Who were turned against the US occupation overnight The next day, at the health ministry, eight of the top 12 jobs were vacant One-third of the entire staff on the ministry was gone Oh my God And now at the ministries, Americans were spending all their time investigating who was And who wasn't a Bath Party member to finish the purge They poured over records and fired more Iraqis Instead of doing things like starting factories up and getting workers paid And making the country secure Fythid Bremer had managed to turn everyone into a guy shuffling through paperwork Oh, and they were purging innocent people The Bath Party wasn't like the Democratic Party in the US You couldn't turn down a promotion in the Bath Party under Saddam Or you would be sentenced to years in prison So these guys had to be Bath Party members Right, so what do you do when you purge? That's it, they're gone Just done? They can never get a job in government again So they're like, go work at a gas station There's no gas, just go It's funny because when it was going on People were always like, man, we shouldn't be building Democrats would be like, you shouldn't be building roads and bridges there You should be building roads and bridges here But it turns out we were building roads and bridges nowhere Right And just up, nobody's Nobody's doing shit We basically like Americanized We did spread America to Iraq We did It's just nobody knew that America spoiled milk I would say Iraq is American about 80 years Yeah So you get put in prison The promotion in the Bath Party got you a monthly raise of 25 bucks if you became a Furka So a lot of people just took it to get an extra 25 bucks a month That's quite a bump Some of them are former soldiers They really didn't give a fuck about Sanam They just wanted a job and extra cash Because of the purge 15,000 teachers were fired Oh my God What is What is Well, this is what happens when you don't This is what happens when you don't read It really is It is a makeover show But they just don't We just don't have the contractor or the plan to rebuild No We're just knocking down everything You have the guy to knock it down And then we're like, oh, we forgot to get a guy to build the ship Under Sanam, the Ministry of Education had told all teachers to join the Bath Party And they were then made Furkas In Sunni areas, entire schools now had just like two teachers Bremer realized this was actually not good Instead of a commission to hear appeals from teachers Okay Uh-huh And he put Shalabi in charge of the commission Oh, God Oh my God Who made sure the appeals weren't heard That's right, okay, get it Bremer was cool with it because he considered the debathification to be, quote, The single most important thing we've done here Oh my God So a shitload of people are out of work And then two days after the purge order, Bush decided to disband the Republican Guard They were the elite forces believed to be loyal to Sanam The regular army guys could stay, though Right, so they still, the army is still intact They didn't even fight during the invasion But where were they? Every military base was empty Not one Iraqi military unit was intact Apparently their leaders had been asking since the invasion ended what the army should do But not one American answered For some reason, the Pentagon assumed the soldiers would just stay in their barracks And wait until they were told what to do Instead, they went home to their families Because, you know, there's a, you know what a war is? Yeah, oh, do we? So they all, they did what Americans wanted They took off their uniforms and they went home and they went to their families And then they were like, fuck, I guess I'll just live at home now So instead of sitting around with no food or supplies in hot barracks with no electricity The US also sort of forgot to tell them that they should stay at the barracks So now the bases were all empty and looted And Fythe looked at the situation and decided the regular army shouldn't be called back And Bremer agreed So instead of vetting and assessing all the soldiers and figuring out which ones to bring back They were just tossed aside Even though they had all been waiting around for orders Thinking they were still part of the army So they didn't fight, they stood aside, they led an army in vain And then they lost their ability to support their family So that's another 300,000 men tossed to the streets That's a million, right now that's a million if you're counting And those are the million that were like, this will help Let alone the ones that are just already fucked Even worse, the Iraqi army was considered the glue of Iraq It helped to hold together all the desperate ethnic and religious groups by stressing national identity And it was gone This was a great move also because unemployment was at 40% Lieutenant General David McKiernan 40% Said of the order Quote, there are a large number of Iraqi soldiers now unemployed This is a huge concern How you doing? It's just, it's like a choose your own adventure But somebody else is choosing the adventure and they're always picking the bad adventure No, don't go, okay Like everything Like every bad, every wrong decision is somebody's like, I'm on board Every single wrong decision they could have possibly made The soldiers protested by the thousands To me, it always felt more like the damage was just We blew everything up and that just sort of fucked the country up And that's why all the civil war because the army just sort of couldn't handle it and didn't want But the idea that there were ways that it maybe could have actually been okay When I finished this research, I realized that it actually could have been okay Soldiers protested by the thousands They lost their jobs, their pensions, their source of pride They just wanted their jobs back But apparently firing guys who took their guns home was the call to make During one protest, two Iraqi soldiers were shot by US troops Which further infuriated all of the laid off soldiers Bremer was slow to react And when a new army was finally created, the old soldiers weren't given preference And they only made an army of 40,000 Months later, a reporter saw one of the protesters and he asked what happened to everyone there Did they join the new army? And the soldier laughed They're all insurgents now 72 hours after the decision was made We just made the army turn against us 72 hours after the army was let go, the first major attack from the airport road took place One furious US general said You guys blindsided CEDCOM We snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and created an insurgency Another said we made hundreds of thousands of people very angry at us And they happened to be the people in the country best acquainted with the use of firearms Also the insurgency meant people had a job again Something to do The insurgents offered unemployed ex-soldiers or ex-bathists up to $100 to shoot Americans or plant land mines I mean that's crazy If they filmed the killing of America they got a bonus Ugh Bremer then met with the leading exiles and told them he had decided there would be no interim government The US would continue to occupy and he was the viceroy and totally in charge He just anointed himself king The Iraqis weren't pleased He then put together a council of 25 Iraqis who would just advise him and write a new constitution But Bremer would have the final decision on everything Meanwhile he ignored a guy named Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani Who was the big dog when it came to Islamic law in the country After it became obvious he shouldn't ignore the Ayatollah, Bremer finally sent a man to meet with Sistani Okay Who did he send to meet with the most powerful religious man in Iraq? No Was it a diplomat? No Someone with experience with rebels? No A urologist What? Wait Why? What? He was an Iraqi American who lived in Florida He had been recruited by the US to help Letting anyone from Florida do this is a red flag to begin with He was recruited by the US to help with reconstruction He was not a diplomat, he was not a politician He was a urologist I'm sorry What am I missing? He speaks the language That's the only reason he sent him to talk to him No He's a urologist No He sent, it's like sending a fucking gynecologist to talk to the pope Like you, you fucking idiot Although I bet you the pope would really start asking something like Like you'd be like, and what does it, like if you could describe the feeling What happens in there, inside What would you describe the feeling? What would it be like? What does it look like? Draw a picture? But the urologist had invented and patented his own penile implant, so that's good They sent a guy who has a patent for a penile implant Yep To talk to the leader of the So well, it's just, it's just Donnie needed to talk about a urinary tract health I don't think that was what I was going to be about So that didn't go well Why? And the CPA quickly learned that the P-Doctor might not be the guy to meet with the Ayatollah What was the Ayatollah just like, what is going on? What's happening? What's going on? What is this? I don't understand, who are you? And then the CPA He just starts talking about the penis implant, like eventually he's just vamping Let me show you something that I want to get into all your people in your country It didn't go well, I tried to sell him a couple of penile implants and he was livid What? I tried to sell him two of my penile implants and he did not take it well No, he's the Ayatollah I understand, and he did not like the demonstration, I have one, I showed him a little bit and one of the men really threw me on the ground hard Oh God I know, that's what I'm like, I said oh God, Allah The CPA then looked into the doctor's background and they found out he had exaggerated his connections to the Bush administration They did that after they sent him to meet with the Ayatollah, they did that after How can lying on your resume at this level work? Like if you're trying to get a job at like Forever 21 Yeah, you can beef up the fucking rez a little bit But how the fuck are you like, wait, oh shit, he really pulled one over on us So Bremer replaced the urologist, a new man would meet with the Ayatollah A stool doctor? So with more experience Whatever you're about to say is not going to be good A pharmaceutical executive from Michigan Oh Jesus Christ, is the idea that you just literally can't send anybody who's not just kind of corrupt? Like you're like, okay, well look, maybe we got to leave government now, who do we go with? Yeah, but if you're a pharmaceutical executive from Michigan and they go, hey, why don't you go meet with the Ayatollah You should say, I don't think that's what I should be doing Oh my God Nobody Dude, it's totally like winning a trip For him, it's like, yeah, it is like you won a vacation The Ayatollah was not impressed He then issued a fatwa You know who we should have sent next, Carrot Top? Let's just get weird People who are just so You sent me Gallagher? Yeah, how did it go? I'm covered in melon I don't know what your country is doing I am covered in melon Okay, you know what we're going to send you Do you know what the Coney Island hot dog eating contest is? There's a guy who won last year No I'm going to send him over Oh wait, Joey Chestnut? Yeah, Joey Chestnut We love him actually, yeah, send him I watch him every year on ESPN Didn't you do a bit about how we should send that to like Ethiopia or something? Oh yeah, I don't know I think I tried that a couple times Yeah, my idea is that we should hold the Nathan's hot dog eating contest in the Sudan And they should do it live there And so they should do it at a camp And then after it's over I would assume the guy as he's shoving the hot dogs into his mouth And watching the crowd of starving people I assume that something would change in him And then he would hopefully weigh down into the crowd And they would tear him apart and eat the hot dogs from his stomach And eat him? No, just tear him apart and then take the hot dogs out Because they're not digested yet Oh, okay And take them out of his swollen Right, okay, so just remove the babies from the throat Like that to me would be a great new way to do that I mean those aren't getting overly chewed So there's definitely hunks in there Sistani issued a fatwa It said that Iraq's constitution had to be written by elected representatives And the committee Bremer had picked was unacceptable No other CPA decided to give a shit about the fatwa They figured, and this is a quote from one of Bremer's aides The view was we'll just get someone to write another fatwa Wait I can't Wait Sorry I had to issue a fatwa Saying they had to hold elections to write a constitution And they wanted to just get a different guy to do a different fatwa So they just, they're out fatwa? They got counter fatwa They got counter fatwa? Yeah Interesting, okay, that's a first Well, they think this is crossfire Right, okay, that's fair But that kind of thinking will make more sense once you understand the hiring process of the CPA Most CPA staffers were chosen because they had a well-connected Republican friend or were recruited by Bush himself Not because they had experience in post-war situations Never that, actually James O'Bearn, a White House envoy, took over recruitment He asked for resumes from the usual places you would go when trying to rebuild a country Sure Republican congressman staffs, conservative think tanks, Republican activists Sure Frederick Smith, deputy director of the CPA Washington office, said the criteria for sending people over there was that they had to have the right political credentials O'Bearn was definitely the correct man for the job He once pointed at an applicant's resume and said, this is the ideal candidate Because he had worked for the Republican party in Florida during the contested presidential election of 2000 Oh, God They asked questions that were very important to nation building, like if the interviewee supported Roe vs. Wade Oh, wow Or if they voted for George W. Bush Oh my God One CPA staffer sent an email to a friend describing the process Quote, I watched resumes of immensely talented individuals who had sought out the CPA to help the country thrown in the trash because of their adherence to the president's vision for Iraq was uncertain So anyone who was Anybody who did Anybody who went in for an interview and said the truth, which is, I don't think Bush knows what he's doing over there Yeah He doesn't actually have a vision Well, that's not blissfully ignorant. That's not what we're looking for They throw that away Yeah So anybody who had any sort of knowledge or smarts was immediately dismissed for telling the truth What would you rather? Would you rather you know, would you rather know about a problem or would you rather just ignore it and never solve it? Yep You don't have to solve a lot of problems if you don't believe them The email continued. I saw senior civil servants from agencies like Treasury Energy and Commerce denied positions that were instead handed to prominent Republican National Committee contributors The good thing was that the recruitment process was very fast because they weren't looking at actual experience Right. Good. It's easy to hire At one point, Bremmer's budget chief asked for 10 new young workers. He got a list. One was the daughter of a new conservative commentator named Michael Lieden One was a recent graduate from an evangelical university for home schooled children Oh my fucking God Another was an aide to Rick Santorum. All 10 were hired Oh God When they got there, they all found out something hilarious They had all sent their resumes to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and ended up getting hired to work in Iraq Oh my God Six of them They couldn't believe it They were like, this is amazing Oh my God Six of them were put in charge of Iraq's $13 billion budget Oh my God They had zero management in the financial world So they took just fucking college kids who had no experience doing anything and put them in charge of the budget of Iraq Right. And it didn't go well, apparently John Agresto was hired as senior advisor to the Ministry of Higher Education, a lifelong Republican and big supporter of the war He got the call early on He actually had experience in the field, surprisingly, and he was going to Iraq to completely redo the university system He was going to get high speed internet going in schools and open liberal art colleges What? What? Why? What? He's going to get high speed internet in there Up in that bitch What? If you're an Iraqi, you're like, okay, thank you, but listen to me, fuck face, I don't have electricity I actually left a story out that I'm going to do as a separate dollop that's really amazing Oh boy Now, he didn't know anything about Iraq's educational system, though Cool So going in, when he arrived in Iraq, he had not read one of the books Quote, I wanted to come here with as open a mind as I could have He said, that came out of his mouth Good A guy going to redo the education, the entire education system in Iraq said, I didn't want to read anything about Iraq It sounds It came out of his mouth It almost sounds like we hired Jaden Smith I only want to read Jaden Smith I only want to read books about Iraq written by my sister Maybe he should have read a book or something because high speed internet wasn't even remotely a possibility Interesting On the ground, what they needed was beyond obvious After being in Baghdad for about a month, Bremer went to a school for a photo op There he saw classrooms with no lights, no fans, no chalk, no blackboard, just empty rooms Bremer promised the headmistress that engineers would visit soon to fix the school Completely renovated, Bremer said And then he told the boy he'd bring soccer balls From the back of the crowd, a woman shouted, please help us, we are very worried about security There are people kidnapping our children We are very scared, another woman yelled Bremer said they're arresting people every day In the back, a teacher yelled, please, we just want to be paid Bremer was then hustled into his SUV, good luck, he yelled Oh my god Thank god that guy's coming to put in the high speed internet How can you have, like, if you're in this country, how can you be like Michael Jackson at a trial? Like, just hopping into it, like, answering two questions on the way to the car and then getting in He'd still give a shit Must be nice When Argesto hit the ground in Iraq, he found out he had no budget for his education reform He thought he would have 25 million He quickly learned that all the money had been given to American universities So they could establish partnerships with Iraqi universities Each American university would decide how to use the money What? Why are you looking at me weird? Because it just doesn't, I don't understand Well, what they did was all the money that was to set aside to rebuild Iraqi schools was given to US schools to dig off with What? Well, it just doesn't even make any sense It does, because a bunch of Republican cunts who are running schools just got a bunch of fucking money and Iraq can go fuck itself God, man It's fine Rumsfeld was always recommending people to work for the CPA At one point, he sent Fythe a memo recommending a guy for a specific position Rumsfeld said the guy had worked in banking and might speak Arabic But later, Rumsfeld was told the CPA had not hired the man He was pissed Oh boy He sent a note I would be curious to have someone check into that and explain to me what in the world is going on I thought we needed people out there Turns out the guy was 80 years old and sort of didn't want to spend a moment of his final years in Iraq Oh, and he had quote connections with shady bank dealings in the Middle East Oh my God So Rumsfeld wanted an 80 year old corrupt asshole to work That's who will get it going Now, some foresight did happen Just not by the Pentagon or the White House or the CPA Before the war, the Justice Department actually hired a guy who was perfect for the job He had experience rebuilding police forces in conflict zones His name was Richard Myers Way before the invasion, he said they would need 5,000 law enforcement advisors to come and train the police Of course, that idea was rejected Of course The Pentagon had just assumed the police would keep working after the invasion Interesting, like the Army But weird thing is they all fled when the invasion started Sure So no cops anywhere At this point, experts said 7,000 police were needed immediately The White House sent fewer Like? A lot fewer Like? 6,999 fewer Uh, dude, what? They sent one person Was it Robocop? Bernie Carrick Former New York police commissioner Oh, that fucking asshole Former military vet Oh God He was a part of the NYPD during 9-11 And he would later go to jail for four years Yeah For eight counts, including criminal conspiracy As a bonus, Carrick had zero experience in a post-war zone Although the White House believed his total lack of experience was an asset That's an amazing way to be It's an amazing thing to think I mean, it really is like You know, you do have total sensitivity towards like 9-11, obviously It's like the craziest thing that's ever happened in this fucking country But the idea that just because a dude was working for the police At the time When that happened Right, it doesn't make him Patriotism Patriotism doesn't give you experience Like there's no No, it's fucking mind-boggling And that's the same idea with hiring Rudy Giuliani for that position before It's like He was there Like they just gave Rudy Giuliani, he just said He was just very compassionate He said shit He wasn't even that compassionate Yeah, and he really wasn't I mean, he was like fake compassionate But that was like Enough Well, look Important things Carrick was a Republican Right And he was a cop Right And he believed in what Bush was doing So he's the guy Carrick agreed, but only wanted to stay for six months Since he was now a partner in Rudy Giuliani's consulting firm And he was making $10,000 a pop for speeches Oh, God I can't afford to be here, he said That's the guy That's the guy The entire time at Iraq, Carrick held a total of two staff meetings Oh, my God One the week he arrived And the other when a New York Times reporter was following him and doing a story on him Oh, wow Now at this time, they needed someone to assess the police and get them back to work They needed a guy with vision who would get the funding needed and hire new police chiefs But Bernie was a street cop And in Iraq, in Baghdad, he found an exact mirror version of himself Oh, dear Ahmad Ibrahim The Iraqi Bernie Carrick He was named the chief of investigations and deputy interior minister Never mind that he had only met a mid-level cop before the war This guy, there's something about this guy So incompetent people are hiring more incompetent people Yeah A copy of a copy of a copy Instead of bringing in the 7,000 It's like multiplicity Foreign police officers needed to train people They brought in one guy who didn't know what he was doing And he hired a guy who didn't know what he was doing Good, perfect Bernie never seemed to understand where he was He shared an office with the CPA's interior ministry who often met with Iraqis Bernie came into the office one day and saw Iraqis around talking to people And loudly said, who the fuck are these people? Oh, Jesus And someone said, oh, those are Iraqis What the fuck are they doing here? Oh, cool Bernie, that's the reason we're here It's their country They're everywhere Bernie cut his six months It's like jumping into the ocean and asking why all the fish are there What's with all these things, these things with the flippers? Bernie cut his six-month tour in half After three months, he left Iraq He didn't tell most of the people who worked for him that he was leaving He was just gone one day Wow He ghosted them He totally ghosted them Awesome Now that the CPA was getting people into positions, they needed to get things fixed and to get people working again The CPA needed 150 factories that were owned by the Ministry of Industry, looked over to figure out which would work OK They hired a man named Glenn Corliss to do the job Corliss was one of the few who came with actual experience to a job that needed it He'd worked on Wall Street and was known for bringing back companies from the brink OK So he arrives And here's the conversation that took place on that day Great CPA OK, you have 150 factories. We want you to evaluate them Corliss, where's my staff? Well, it's you OK, where's the management of the companies? We fired the management because of debathification Where are the financials? There are no financials How much time do I have? Two weeks What? 150 factories He has no staff, he has no money, he has to do it in two weeks Everything sounds like a reality show It's like a movie plot He's two weeks, what is it? Two weeks, 150 countries? So here's how the companies worked under Saddam They were state owned and made a bunch of shit that wasn't very good Notebooks, batteries, all kinds of fucking crap But a factory job was a government job and you got a nice salary for the rest of your life Many people employed at factories didn't even have anything to do They just sat around, employed The salary was low but the government took care of everything Gasoline was almost free, electricity was free, college was free, health care was free People got food every month from the government So that's how they're living their life So you had a whole society basically living off of the government And it was the only thing they knew, they had been doing this for decades So when Corliss told them their system was screwed up, they looked at him like he was insane Yeah Corliss quickly realized privatization was not happening If they sold out the factories, many people would lose their jobs just increasing the already massive unemployment numbers There wasn't even electricity or raw materials to work with, many of the factories were worthless already They should just be shut down, but Corliss recommended shutting them down and then continuing to pay the employees forever Because you can't just get rid of, because there's so many unemployed And the factories don't actually make anything So he's like, well just fire them, just get rid of the companies and just keep paying them And hopefully they'll start their own businesses or something Jesus Christ If you're one of them, jackpot Yeah, there just wasn't another solution in his eyes And this is the guy who fucking does this The guy above Corliss who made the call and stuff like that was named Peter McPherson He'd been the president of Michigan University, worked under Reagan in international development for seven years, was VP at Bank of America And most importantly he was buddies with Dick Cheney And he strongly believed that it was very important to shrink government employment and not increase it The faster they could eliminate subsidies and get privatization going, the quicker shit would turn around Well, but... He had only asked for 130 days leave from Michigan University, so he was thinking he could crank this shit out in four months He's really like, he's on board McPherson believed strongly the way to cure all problems was to reduce taxes and privatize Oh, I love, okay No, go ahead I mean, let's love how we're like, yeah Reaganomics That's what you guys need He went into a country and said Reaganomics Reaganomics Also, CPA lawyers said privatizing the factories would violate the Hague Convention McPherson looked at the looting that had occurred as necessary shrinkage Sure It was like the natural selection, but for business, the good companies would now... I love how all the right-wingers believe in survival of the fittest and like Darwin when it comes to this shit With this shit When it comes to actual, when it comes to us, it's like, oh, it's preposterous Now let them work themselves up, that's how nature does it Oh no, God created us Yeah, in a pot in the sky So he thought the good companies would now flourish He looked at everything that way, a lot of police cars had been stolen and turned into taxis Good, he said, privatization That's privatization Democracy in motion Bus drivers are now driving their own routes and just pocketing the money Sure, privatization Privatization So this stuff's all good, but there are a couple of big problems, debt Iraq's banks were one million in debt So McPherson just wiped out all the debts from government-run businesses Okay And anyone who knows anything about business knows that weak companies usually owe strong companies money So now the factories that had actually been profitable suddenly had no money Oh good And a bunch of companies that were shit had money or usually just goods that they had bought from the strong companies Right Like one company now had a giant mountain of free cotton they could use to make clothing, but they were a shit company Right, so they just made shit They just had free, they had free cotton Right So overnight he destroyed every strong government-run company Jesus It's so great He was right though, he will be out pretty fast His plan's going to be done real quick McPherson then did what every Iraqi had been waiting for since the tanks rolled into Baghdad Left? He cut the top tax rate from 45% to a flat tax of 15% Okay Boom Right? Yeah Most Iraqis didn't pay taxes Now, we're six months into the occupation and assaults on the Green Zone begin All those released Iraqi soldiers and fire people finally found something to do Suddenly the people that worked for the CPA started to have an actual look around at what was going on And they were forced to do this because bombs were coming over the walls of their secure zone Well I guess they didn't know about the Green Zone It's like GUL, can tag, can't tag me, I'm on GUL GUL They realized this wasn't good and it suddenly started to dawn on them that without security they couldn't make liberal arts colleges or privatize the factories or get election going Yeah, I mean the ballerinas are going to be really affected by this Right Yeah, for sure But they were so far past fucked at this point that it's amazing, the entire CPA was in Iraq The entire time the CPA was in Iraq The CPA actually had no idea how many people worked for the CPA Okay I mean Like I just, I'm starting to feel like I could do some of this shit Yeah And that's not good No, it's very bad This made it hard for them to ask for more people One CPA minister said, quote, we never had a good grip on how many people were in the CPA Sometimes people just showed up in Baghdad and sometimes people just left What? Hey, I'm working for you guys Okay I'm going to leave now All right It ended up taking six months to get CPA staff into all 18 Iraq provinces And when they did get the staff there, the staff were so small they were completely overwhelmed, running them almost pointless They needed a lot more staff everywhere In May 2003, the regional coordinator for South Iraq wrote, our window for influencing the course of events in the South will be gone in two to three weeks In two to three weeks it was Of course, despite reality being smashed into his face, Bremer continued to push for privatization He thought it was, quote, essential for Iraq's economic recovery But the factories at this point were a train wreck Fayez Aziz ran a government vegetable oil company He had fired a lot of men before and they were demanding their jobs back They were saying, quote, either you get us back to work or we're going to do something One day a former employee came into Aziz's office with a hand grenade and demanded his job back or he would blow them both up Aziz managed to talk the man down It didn't matter Two days later, Aziz was pulled from his car and gunned down in the street by eight men Now this changed everything Privatization suddenly looked like it would be more difficult than everyone thought If they fired thousands of workers, what would happen? Fortunately, the dream of Bush and company was still alive Tom Foley arrived two weeks after Aziz was killed, his job to work on private sector development He was an investment banker who had gone to Harvard with President Bush and he had a bold plan He wanted to privatize all of Iraq's state-owned businesses in 30 days Again, reality show A contractor told them it couldn't be done because for one reason, international law prevents the sale of assets by an occupational government Foley responded, I don't care about any of that stuff I don't give a shit about international law I made a commitment to the president that I'd privatize Iraq's business Wow, what a great attitude Fuck you, everyone who's not W Yeah, right? International law International law I don't give a fuck about international law My bro invaded this place, I'm going to set shit straight I don't give a fuck about international law Iraq is being run by a fraternity at this point Yeah, and probably not the best fraternity on campus No, not the academic one No, certainly not that one, the one where you're like, don't go there, you'll get roofied Yeah, it's being run by roofiers But Foley was forced to face facts after the killing with the state of the factories, the debt debacle It became clear, clear, and quickly that selling off the factories was a bad idea Oh, and illegal Right He decided to lease them instead, which he was very sad about The only hitch was that any investor leasing a factory had to agree to not fire any employees I mean, that is not going to go down well Strangely, no one stepped forward to lease a factory One would think that without adequate electricity, an internet, terrible phone service, an airport that still wasn't open, and violence increasing by the day that companies would jump to lease a business Yeah, let's go, get out there, get involved, meet the people But they didn't Put your goods on display Now, being a master of timing, Bremer then decided it was the moment to deal with all the food rations the Iraqis got from the government Oh, good, finally, let's start toying with that Look, tons of people are out of work and joining the insurgency every day, what's the best thing to do right now? Get rid of their food Make it hard for them to eat He decided the government shouldn't hand out food, as had been happening for decades But instead the government should give out debit cards and then private companies could distribute the food So what he's doing is trying to figure out any way to privatize something He wants something privatized And is it just, why? The main reason being? To privatize Just because of the philosophy of it Yes Because you would think that there would be more Well, there's one problem with the plan No, the plan is the problem No one in Iraq used credit cards or debit cards I don't understand why What? This is a good idea Why would you go there and be like, let's turn this place into the fifth element Let's really have a little fun here Like, they don't know what those are Like, just, you can't, I mean, what do you want? It'll work You're not going there to make Yankee fans Just go there to like, just fucking, like, let them have their shit Give them food, food There were no ATMs You've killed, you've definitely killed someone they're related to And you've definitely killed a friend of theirs There were no ATMs So then what are they gonna... And there wouldn't be for a long time because there wasn't consistent electricity or phone service So basically they would be giving people a magic piece of plastic that trapped their money inside of it I mean, that's what the government really is, so... Bremer did not care about all the negative Nazis in their blah, blah, blah He decided to move forward with a debit card plan Good Then the military heard about the idea and immediately killed it because they did not like the idea of food riots Yeah He was going to do it even though there was no infrastructure What would be, what would, like... It would be like giving people... Are you just trying to make the biggest riot? It's like giving people, like you give them all a thing to ride a water slide on Right Okay everybody, here's the water slide cloth that you ride on And everyone's like, there's no water slides Use your cloth Use your cloth, buddy There's no slide to ride it on I mean, it really is so fucked up Slowly the country began to completely destabilize The Shiites and Baghdad slums started fighting US forces And not just a little bit, this is full on fighting All the while, Bremer... But at least they're getting along finally Yep All the while, Bremer tried to put together some sort of functioning government This usually just led to more fighting Good While all this was going on, the insurgency in the Sunni-dominated west of the country increased Because those were the people most affected by the debathification and the firing of workers Good For the first time ever, the country of Iraq was breaking off into different ethnic and religious groups Previously, they had thought of themselves as Iraqis first Now that was gone Meanwhile, Bremer was having problems He had formed the Iraq Governing Council to create a constitution All the members of the governing council had supported the American invasion of Iraq Good Grand Ayatollah Sistani had said the constitution had to be drafted by elected politicians Bremer did not want that because he wanted the new constitution to have the separation of church and state in it Oh Because he was fucking insane Jesus Christ So the US now found itself in the rather awkward position of an Iraqi religious leader calling for democracy And the US working to stop democracy Wow, I mean, that says a lot By September 2003, the population was done with the occupation Things were far worse than they had been in the Sanam They only got 12 hours of power a day Unemployment was rampant Insurgent attacks were increasing constantly It was a total fuck up in their eyes More and more believed the occupation was doing more harm than good And they started joining up with the insurgents Every time Bremer tried to delay an election or drop a constitution with the council The Ayatollah would release a message and the whole thing would be fucked The UN got involved Bremer refused to meet with Sistani Saying Sistani was saying different stuff to different people What a pussy What a fucking pussy Well, the way if someone is saying different stuff to different people is to go sit down with them and fucking talk to them It's so bitchy It's like high school He's a little bitch Bremer just didn't think the country was ready for voting By the time Bremer came around to meeting with the Ayatollah, the Ayatollah wouldn't see any Americans So now the British were sending representatives to talk to Bremer about the Ayatollah's positions But Bremer would not listen to them The old stick and your finger and your ears move In the West, shit was going south fast In March 2004, four American contractors were ambushed and killed in Fallujah Bush wanted revenge And against recommendations from the military because they said it would look like revenge He decided to attack Fallujah Which was largely held by insurgents now These were soldiers and factory workers who had been let go by Bremer Because they were bathys Right So the military attacked Fallujah As warned, it didn't do great things to keep all smooth in the government The Sunnis and the council demanded an end to it immediately The military, who strangely believed that you shouldn't start something unless you plan on finishing it, were told to stop the attack Interesting They estimated they were two days from taking the city Now, some old Iraqi army generals were brought in to negotiate Okay They said they could bring in some old Iraqi Fallujah soldiers from the army to handle the situation and deal with the insurgents Okay The US agreed Strangely, it didn't go as planned Interesting The Iraqi soldiers did not go after the insurgents They just set up checkpoints around town They also refused to wear the new Iraqi uniforms given to them by the US Instead, wore their old Iraqi uniforms Oh wow, throwbacks Then the checkpoints went away pretty quick Okay All the equipment that had been given to the Iraqi soldiers, humvees, tons of weapons, to fight the Fallujah fight ended up in an insurgents hand Good Because Good, now they have tanks They were insurgents the whole time Right So We brought It was the slow-com We negotiated with the enemy Right And gave them guns to stop themselves In our defense, we did get a pretty good deal out of it We kind of took them to the cleaners on that one Imagine them negotiating like, hey for fun, push back Not good enough Shit, they're really good I mean, they obviously seem invested Okay, yeah, we'll do it You like more humvees? Okay, yeah And more, many more guns? Sure, that'll help Yeah Do you know we are the same guys? Nothing Voice got super high there, so Okay I can see you Okay Back in Washington, the White House really, really, really wanted this thing with the Ayatollah worked out And fast, because U.S. presidential elections were coming And Bush needed good news Bush needed, yeah So what's great is he's already been on the aircraft carrier He's already been on the Yeah, oh yeah Mission accomplished Condoleezza Rice decided Bremer had to listen to the Ayatollah about how to do the election The UN came back in and convinced the Ayatollah elections couldn't happen until December But Bremer kept rejecting all of the Ayatollah's demands The way the Ayatollah wanted things, it would lead to a religious democracy Which is how the people of Iraq wanted, but not Bremer and Chani and Faith and Company Finally, Bremer was called to Washington where it was hammered into his head that the U.S. presidential election was the most important thing Bremer came back and agreed to hold elections in January 2005 for a parliament and government who would then put together a constitution And this is exactly what the Ayatollah had wanted all along The CPA then pushed for an election within a year and then Iraq would be turned over by the U.S. They set it up so it would happen four months before the U.S. presidential election Perfect Because they wanted to do it fast to get Bush some sweet PR The only way it could occur in such a time is if the entire country was a single electoral district Regardless of where in Iraq he lived, they would choose from the same list of candidates So basically what happened was Bremer kept fucking everything up and pushing shit back And then Bush started panicking about getting reelected We need four more years of this leadership So then they rushed an election instead of doing it right because he was... This was going to make things difficult in the Zuni areas where the insurgency was strong Not only would voting be a problem, but because of security the Sunnis didn't have big parties anymore The Ba'ath Party was gone, now it was little political parties vying for control Many wanted Bremer in the White House Wait... Many warned Bremer in the White House that having one electoral constituency would lead to a disaster It didn't matter, they wanted to get it done The elections were a disaster Zuni politicians boycotted, insurgents scared people away from voting The Sunnis who made up 20% of the population had 8% of the seats in the legislature So the Shiites and Kurds had majorities in the government Then the government sat back and watched as Shiite and Kurd militias grabbed up young Sunnis, tortured them and killed them Now Sunnis started attacking Shiites and Kurds instead of just Americans Mixed religious neighborhoods in Baghdad, as they had been for decades, broke apart Sunnis fled to Shiite neighborhoods and vice versa They were heading towards civil war When it came time to write the constitution, it became even worse Sunnis had no representation so they hated the constitution and it was on The Sunni insurgents formed Al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2004 Which then slowly turned into the Islamic State through different events The US pulled out its troops in December 2011 ISIS recruited while the Shiites used oppression in the Sunni areas Then war broke out in Syria between Sunnis and Shiites The Sunnis went to fight there and there they learned how to fight and slowly ISIS formed The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is what we have now When Bremer left in June 2004, he said the CPA had set up Iraq perfectly It was now on the way to being a democratic country with modern infrastructure and a free market During an interview with a reporter, Bremer said Iraq had been, quote, fundamentally changed for the better. What was Bremer most proud of doing? I can't wait to hear what his prideful moment is Lowering the tax rate? Sure The liberalization of foreign investment laws? Right, that one, right And of course the reduction of import duties?
